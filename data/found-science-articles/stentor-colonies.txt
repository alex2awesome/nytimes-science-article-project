Many single-celled organisms exhibit both solitary and colonial existence.
Animportant step towards multicellularity, which is associated with

benefits such as enhanced nutrient uptake, was the formation of colonies of
unicellular organisms. However, the initial drivers that favoured individual
cells aggregating into more complex colonies are less clear. Here we show
that hydrodynamic coupling between proximate neighbours results

in faster feeding flows for neighbouring ciliates, such that individuals
within a dynamic colony have stronger average feeding flows than solitary
individuals. Flows generated by individuals acting together reach higher
velocities, thus allowing access to a wider range of prey resources than
individuals acting on their own. Moreover, we find that accrued feeding
benefits are typically asymmetric: whereas all individuals benefit from acting
together, those with slower solitary currents gain more from partnering
than those with faster currents. We find that colonial organization in

simple unicellular organisms is beneficial for all its members. This provides
fundamental insights into the selective forces favouring the early evolution
of multicellular organization.

Suspension-feeding unicellular protists inhabit a fluid world domi-
nated by viscous forces that limit prey transport for feeding’ *. Many of
these organisms generate ciliary microcurrents that actively transport
the dissolved nutrients and smaller prey critical for their nutrition’*”.
Aprotist’s ability to favourably alter its feeding current for enhanced
feeding would, therefore, be beneficial to its survival. Can colony for-
mation enable unicellular protists to enhance their feeding flows?
Colony-forming protists can broadly be classified based on the
presence (or absence) of physical linkages between colony mem-
bers. Organisms, including Volvox carteri’ and the choanoflagellate

Salpingoeca rosetta’, form colonies of physically attached members
that serve as models for studying the evolution of multicellularity”””’.
Volvox forms spherical colonies with individual cells embedded within
an extracellular matrix jointly secreted by identical, clonal colony
members. The combined flows can act over longer distances'° and
transport greater amounts of fluid per individual’°", which enables
Volvox colony members to grow and reproduce faster?’?.

However, if we step backwards, before these more advanced exam-
ples, many colony-forming protists aggregate in high numbers with no
observable linkages between colony members. This basal condition

mimicking multicellular-like behaviour precedes the evolution of an
organizing extracellular matrix or cell-cell junctions, as seen in Volvox
or choanoflagellates’. We, therefore, wondered whether individuals in
sucha loosely organized colony are capable of coordinating their activ-
ity to achieve common goals and whether such cooperationis an exclu-
sive ability of colonies containing physically connected individuals.

To answer this question, we considered two issues: the positioning
of individuals ina colony with no commonextracellular matrix and the
hydrodynamic consequences of such colony formation. Specifically,
we chose the ciliated unicellular protist Stentor coeruleus. Stentor
individuals generate feeding currents by beating bands of cilia near
their ‘heads’ at their anterior end and attach onto organic surfaces
(suchas leaves and twigs in freshwater ponds) with an organelle called
a ‘holdfast’ at their posterior end” (Fig. 1a,b). S. coeruleus occur as
freely swimming individuals under low prey conditions’. However, in
higher food conditions, Stentor individuals can reversibly aggregate
into hemispherical colonies by anchoring themselves onto surfaces
in close proximity to each other (Fig. 1c). Colony members sway their
feeding apparatus back and forth without detaching their holdfast
(Supplementary Video 1). We examined the hydrodynamic cooperation
between these unconnected colony members and found that, although
benefits accrue for neighbouring individuals, the benefits are typically
asymmetric between individuals and hydrodynamic cooperation is
highly promiscuous among colony members.

Individual S. coeruleus freely suspended in water were incubated
alone or in groups in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chamber where
they attached to the glass coverslip (Extended Data Fig. 1). Feeding cur-
rents generated by the Stentor oral cilia’*"° were visualized by adding a
dilute amount of milk and quantified using micro-particle image veloci-
metry (PIV)'”” (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Videos 2 and 3, and Extended
Data Fig. 2)”. Feeding currents exhibited two symmetric regions of recir-
culating flows with opposing spin, which we termed ‘vortices’. These vor-
tices are probably due to the confinement between two bounding walls
inthe experimental chamber”, whereas Stentorsin the wild are typically
bounded only by the substrate to which they attach. The measured flow
velocities were the highest (-100 pm s”) near the oral apparatus, and
the magnitude tapered off by an order of magnitude over a distance
equivalent to organismal size (-1 mm) (Supplementary Video 4). As only
the orthogonal portion of the flow between the two vortices reached
the oral opening and could be productively filtered for prey, we defined
the feeding flow velocity (U) as the downward velocity component
averaged across aline with the same size as the oral opening (Extended
Data Fig. 3). The average feeding current velocity of solitary individuals
was found to be about 70 + 18 pms“ (+1 standard deviation for n= 16)
(Extended Data Fig. 4). This velocity corresponds to approximately
3.4 x 10° body volumes cleared per hour, which lies within the 10° to 10°
body volumes per hour range of clearance rates commonly described
for protists living ina variety of aquatic environments”. We observed
athreefold difference between the strongest and weakest solitary flows.

When several individuals were incubated, the organisms
self-assembled into colonies such that the holdfasts of individuals
were anchored on the glass coverslip in close proximity to each other
(Fig. 1c,e). This behaviour was conserved in both of the Stentor spe-
cies we examined: S. muelleri, which were acquired from their native
environment (Fig. 1c), and the laboratory-cultured S. coeruleus (Fig. le).
Unlike solitary individuals, colonies exhibited flow fields with large
numbers of complex interfering vortices (Fig. le), possibly due to
crosstalk between solitary flows of proximate individuals.

Toinvestigate the Stentor-generated flows, we builta mathematical
model in which the ciliary activity of each Stentor was approximated
by a point force located at the mouth and pointing inward (Fig. If,
inset). In our model, a single parameter, the magnitude of the force F
exerted on the fluid, subsumes the details of the cilia length, beating
frequency and waveform. Dimensional analysis shows that F = nUH,
where nis the fluid viscosity, His the length of atypical Stentor (-1 mm)

and Visa typical flow speed (-100 pms”). When placed between two
no-slip boundaries (as in our experiments), the point force creates
two-dimensional recirculating flows ina plane parallel to the bounding
walls (Fig. 1f), consistent with theory” and empirical observations”°.
Importantly, the confined point-force model faithfully reproduced
the experimental flow fields created by solitary (Fig. 1d,f) and colonial
individuals (Fig. le,g).

To test whether proximity between individuals enhances the feed-
ing flow, we evaluated pairs of S. coeruleus. Two individuals attached to
aglass coverslip exhibited head movements with respect to each other
without altering their anchor locations, so that the head separation
distance A varied over time. The flow field changed as a function of
head separation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Video 5). As the separa-
tion was gradually reduced, their otherwise independent flows with
feeding velocities of between 120 and 190 pm s* began interacting.
The independent vortical structures of the two individuals became
asymmetric, with inner vortices decreasing in size (Fig. 2a), until at
zero separation (A = 0), only two external vortices remained, and the
flow field resembled that expected froma S. coeruleus much larger than
either individual alone (feeding velocity about 330 pm s*; Fig. 2b,cand
Supplementary Video 6). This translates into an asymmetric benefit
of x2.8 and x1.7 enhancement in feeding flow for the two adjoining
individuals, respectively. Hence, the flow enhancements for the two
individuals were asymmetric. The weaker individual gained more
from the pairing than the stronger one. This pattern was observed
across different Stentor pairs (Fig. 2d). This was not caused by increased
ciliary beating by nearby individuals, as we found no evidence that
the frequency of the ciliary waves was altered as the separation dis-
tance between individuals was changed (Extended Data Fig. 5).

To better mimic Stentor behaviour in the wild, we modelled
each S. coeruleus as a regularized stokeslet placed near only one wall
(Fig. 3a)?°??°, The direction of the force was determined by the incli-
nation angle 6 from the vertical plane and a sway angle @ in the hori-
zontal plane. When bounded by a single wall, we observed no vortices
(Extended Data Fig. 6). Considering 6 = 0 (forces perpendicular to the
boundary), our model predicted that the combined velocity profile
depended upon two main factors: the strengths F, and F, of the indi-
viduals and the separation distance A. For pairs of equal strength, the
flow field is left-right symmetric for all values of A (Extended Data
Fig. 7), whereas for individuals of unequal strengths, the flow field was
asymmetric (Fig. 3b,c).

How do these asymmetries affect feeding flows of interacting
Stentors? To compare the gains in pairs of individuals of unequal
strengths, we used our mathematical model and employed two
quantitative metrics: the average feeding flow U to each Stentor,
i=1,2,and anew metric, ‘the benefit of being together’, which we
defined as the difference between the feeding flow when in partner-
ship compared to when in solitary feeding, normalized by the latter,
Benefit = (rie Uricary ~d.

We conducted two sets of simulations with 6= 0 and 6 = 0.25t.
We found in both cases that, compared with solitary feeding, a Stentor
gets a net gain in feeding flow rate when placed in close proximity toa
partner (Fig. 3d). Importantly, even though each Stentor gains by part-
nering, the relative benefit is asymmetric (Fig. 3g), with the weaker
partner benefiting more, as observed experimentally.

Because solitary individuals exhibit a wide dispersion in their flow
velocities, we explored a wide range of Stentor strength ratio (F,/F,) at
two different inter-Stentor separation distances, A = 0.05 and A= 0.25
times body length H (1mm). For all strength ratios, the pair with the
smaller separation distance had a higher average feeding flow (Fig. 3e).
Additionally, the weaker partner had a higher benefit. Thus, itis always
better to bein close proximity to a stronger neighbour (Fig. 3h).

In our model thus far, we assumed parallel individuals, but in our
experiments, we found individuals pointing in different directions,
and more interestingly, individuals in a colony continuously altering

not only their positions in the colony but also their orientations (Sup-
plementary Video 1). For a static pair of individuals (same H, A and
F,=F,=F), the feeding flow rate depends upon the inclination angle 0
and sway angle @. Two individuals are cooperative when they point in
the same direction and yield positive benefit or antagonistic when they

point in opposite directions and yield negative benefit. However, it is
unclear how dynamic changes in orientation and sway angles influence
feeding flow rates. To answer this question, we chose @ = 0.251
and added independent Gaussian noises of zero mean to the sway
angles @, and @, to make the individuals deviate from the parallel

the horizontal axis scales from the greatest separation distance onthe left to
the least distance on the right. As the interindividual distance decreased, the
average velocity of both members of the pair increased significantly (all linear
regressions, P< 0.001). Increased velocities as members of a pair neared each
other followed the same pattern. The regression slopes were not significantly
different for the three pairs (ANCOVA equal slopes test, 2 degrees of freedom,
P<0.59), but the regression intercepts were significantly different (ANOVA
for equal slopes, 2 degrees of freedom, P< 0.001) due to initial differences
between the members of each interacting pair. e,f, Flow fields visualized in the

configuration. The standard deviation of the sway angle (0.11) was
guided by our experimental observations (Fig. 2b). Using Monte Carlo
simulations, we computed the feeding flow rate and benefit to Stentor
lat various strength ratios. Even though the noise had zero mean, the
mean feeding flow rate for the Monte Carlo simulations was lower than
the feeding flow rate without noise, because the two individuals were
most cooperative if p, = @2,and noise drove the pair out of their most
cooperative orientation. However, this reduction in mean feeding flow
rate and benefit was minimal; the differences between the curves in
Fig. 3e,fand Fig. 3h,i are barely noticeable. A standard deviation of 0.1m
in the sway angles reduced the feeding flow rate and benefit by only
5%. Adding Gaussian noise to the inclination angles and the separation
distance revealed qualitatively similar results (Extended Data Fig. 8).

Given that for a pair of individuals the benefit is asymmetric, ifthe
pairings were permanent, one individual would always be ata loss, thus
creating an imbalance. The dynamic nature of Stentor colonies (Fig. 4
and Supplementary Video 1) addresses this imbalance by encourag-
ing promiscuity between partners in a colony. We found that within
acolony, the nearest neighbour of each member frequently changes
(Fig. 4), as there is almost always a neighbour less than 0.25 mm away
inacolony (Fig. 4c). Indeed, about 86% of the time, each individual has

aneighbour less than 0.025 mm away and 93% of the time a neighbour
less than 0.05 mm away (Fig. 4c). This also explains why organismsina
pair donotalways maintain the shortest possible separation to ensure
maximal flow rates (Fig. 2). From an evolutionary standpoint, indi-
viduals are expected to seek the most favourable energetic pay-off by
associating with a neighbouring individual that benefits them the most.
One way to accomplish this is to keep switching between neighbouring
partners, particularly ina heterogeneous environment when they are
changing their location or height ina colony or going through contrac-
tion and extension cycles”””*. Such an asymmetric advantage favours a
dynamic pattern in which colony members continuously change their
positions with respect to each other with the result of maximizing
their fluid flux. Note that in a colony, an individual moving away from
one neighbour will move closer to another neighbour (Fig. 4a). Study-
ing the effect of colony size and organization on feeding flow rates is
challenging experimentally. We, thus, extended our model to include
Nindividuals per colony distributed uniformly along a ring of radius
equal to H (1mm) (Fig. 5a, inset), which is like the organization in the
inset of Fig. 4c. For non-zero inclination angles, the sway angle of each
Stentor was chosen such that the force pointed towards the centre of
the colony. For small colonies, a reduction in intake velocities occurred

due to counter flows by stentors on the diametrically opposite side of
the colony, but as the colony size was increased, neighbouring forces
became more aligned, leading to a higher feeding flow rate (Fig. 5a).
When adding Gaussian noise to the Stentor positions to mimic dynamic
colonies (Fig. 4), we found an enhancement in average feeding rate
(Fig. 5b). A similar enhancement was obtained for a range of 8 values
(Fig. 5b shows only two representative cases to avoid clutter). These
results demonstrate that irregular arrangements are advantageous
because they create pairs with smaller separation distances.

To date, the benefits of colony formation have been investigated
in comparatively advanced organisms, where colony members are
either embedded in the same matrix (for example, a Volvox carteri
colony’ contains two differentiated cell types held together in an extra-
cellular matrix) or physically attached to each other (for example,
Zoothamnium duplicatum and choanoflagellate Codosiga botrytis”’).
By contrast, Stentor coeruleus is a truly unicellular organism, exhibit-
ing a basal-colony-forming behaviour in which unit cells can reversibly

aggregate to form dynamic multicellular-like colonies. Unlike Volvox,
members of a Stentor colony are not physically connected to each
other. Our results demonstrate that proximity between individuals
is sufficient to enhance the feeding currents. Faster flows can poten-
tially increase the rate of prey encounter and capture and, therefore,
provide colony members witha selective advantage over their solitary
counterparts. This leads to the question: why would such an organism
ever transition back toa solitary state when colonial organization has
selective survival advantages? The answer may reflect the pattern
among the genus Stentor to detach from their colonial organization
and swim alone during periods of low prey abundance“ or to avoid
danger*®. Although detachment from anchoring has been reported to
reduce the prey encounter rate by about 30% to 70% for some flagellates
(Pteridomonas danica and Paraphysomonas vestita)", it enables rapid
swimming and more effective manoeuvring. These traits are valuable
for cruising-mode foraging and for avoiding threats. In contrast, Vol-
vox colonies cannot disassemble, even under starvation conditions”.

Recent computational studies have reported intriguing relation-
ships between hydrodynamic coupling and feeding flows in choano-
flagellate colonies. Although hydrodynamic cooperation between
neighbouring choanoflagellates is thought to increase fluid supply to
the colony”, fluid flux across collars of individual choanoflagellates
is thought to be greatest when they are freely swimming alone, with
sessile colony formation leading to a decreased flux per individual”.
Unlike choanoflagellates, which are mostly found swimming (alone
or in colonies), Stentors are normally found attached to surfaces.
Importantly, the prediction" that in a colony with morphologically
similar units the members should arrange themselves in a manner
to maximize fluid flux implies that once an optimal arrangement is
achieved, it should remain unchanged to ensure the continuation of
the maximal benefit. This is true in Volvox, where the unit cells remain
fixed on a uniform spheroid’®. Counter-intuitively, we observed
that the separation between members oscillates over time, raising
the possibility that this oscillatory behaviour might be an inherent
property of the organism. Further, differences between Volvox and
Stentor colonies may be influenced by their physical organization.
Unlike clonal members of a Volvox colony, Stentors in a colony do
not constitute a homogeneous population and may include a vari-
ety of genotypes. Individuals within the same population possess a
wide dispersion in size as well as in the velocity of their feeding cur-
rents (Extended Data Fig. 4). These disparities between individuals
can have major implications for their ability to get the most out of
colony formation.

Although we have here assumed that the prey can be treated as
small, passive tracer particles, wild Stentors feed on smaller motile
organisms such as the algae Chlamydomonas", which themselves
swim at speeds of about 100 pms" (ref. 34). Successful capture of
motile prey would require Stentors to generate flow fields with veloci-
ties greater than the prey swimming velocity. Our analysis shows that
solitary Stentors generate flows with an average velocity ~70 pms*
(Extended Data Fig. 4). Asa result, the likelihood that solitary individu-
als can entrain and capture live prey moving at such high speeds is very
low. Notably, our experiments show that stentors ina pair are able to
achieve flow velocities two to three times those of Chlamydomonas
prey velocities.

The dynamic changes in position of individuals within a colony
may also alleviate another key challenge for filter feeders attached to
surfaces, namely refiltration and recirculation. Recirculation is high-
est when organisms push liquid perpendicular to the surfaces of their
attachment, and even very slow external flows are thought to help
overcome challenges associated with flow recirculation®. In a Sten-
tor colony, however, most individuals are attached at acute angles to
the surface and actively vary their position as well as their inclination
angle with respect to their attachment surface” (Fig. 4), indicating
that recirculation is not a major issue, even in the absence of external
flows, as in our experiments, where individuals remained attached to
the glass coverslip for several hours with no external flows.

Taken together, our experimental and modelling analysis shows
that although S. coeruleus colonial organization appears to be less
advanced than that of Volvox, the ability of colony members to dynami-
cally alter their morphology and location endows it with very unique
benefits. Together, these findings demonstrate that the reversible
and dynamic nature of S. coeruleus colonies represents a transition
between isolated individuals and a coordinated colony that mutually
benefits all individuals.

Methods
S. coeruleus and S. muelleri culturing
S. coeruleus cells were obtained commercially (Carolina Biological Sup-
ply) and were subsequently cultured as described earlier®. Briefly, cells
were grown in the dark at 20 °C in modified Stentor medium (0.75 mM
Na,CO,, 0.15 mM KHCO,, 0.15 mM NaNO,, 0.15 mM KH,PO,, 0.15 mM
MgSO,,0.5 mM CaCl, and 1.47 mM NaCl) modified from recipes by Tar-
tar’ and De Terra*®. This medium was supplemented with living prey,
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which were washed in modified Stentor
medium before being added to the S. coeruleus cultures for feeding.
A few grains of boiled wheat seeds were also added to the S. coeruleus
cultures to promote further microbial growth. C. reinhardtii cells were
added to the S. coeruleus cultures two or three times per week.
Stentor colonies in the wild were found attached to fixed solid sur-
faces including organic matter in freshwater aquatic bodies. S. muelleri
were taken from Shivericks Pond in Falmouth, MA, United States. About
21 of pond water along with organic matter, like leaves and twigs, were
collected from a shaded part of the pond. The sample was brought
back to the laboratory, mixed vigorously by shaking the bottles and
then allowed to settle for about 10 min. The water containing the freely
swimming organisms was then separated from the organic matter and
poured into a borosilicate glass flask. S. muelleri were identified under
astereo microscope andisolated using a P1000 pipette into a separate
flask. Filtered pond water was added to the culture, and S. muelleriwere
used in the experiments over the next 24 h.

Microscopy, data acquisition and analysis
Stentors suspended in water mixed with whole milk (diluted x500) were
incubated ina chamber formed by attaching two coverslips onto either
side ofaPDMS ring 5 mm in diameter and 700 pm high (Extended Data
Fig. 1). The patterns illustrated in Figs. 1b,c and 4a were general patterns
representative of the ~50 colonies observed in the laboratory. The
stentors usually anchored themselves onto the lower glass coverslip
attached to the PDMS chamber. Once anchored onto the coverslip, the
stentors were imaged in dark field using a x4 objective on an inverted
microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U) using the software Photron FAST-
CAM Viewer (PFV4). The depth of field for this objective was 55.5 pm.
The head (oral region) of a Stentor is approximately 150 pm wide, so
the image focal plane for measuring particle motion represented an
optical slice through the three-dimensional space encompassed by
the flow field generated by the Stentor ciliary bands. When viewing
several stentors shifting both inclination angle 6 and sway angle @,
some flow components occurred outside the measured viewing plane.
We minimized this by selecting image sequences in which measured
particle flows occurred almost exclusively within the viewing plane.
For flow visualization, dark-field time-lapsed images of the anchored
stentors with milk particles in their surrounding liquid were acquired
at 500 frames per second using a high-speed colour camera (Fastcam
1024 SA3, Photron), such that 1 pixel on the camera corresponded to
4.2 um. Whether the increase in feeding current velocity associated
with pairing also translates into higher prey capture rates was difficult
to test because of a Stentor’s sensitivity to bright visible light, which
prevented us from performing quantitative imaging of prey capture.
Median images were calculated for each video using Fijiand were
subtracted from individual video frames to eliminate particles stuck
onthe surface. These processed images were Z-projected using Fijito
generate images of flow streamlines (Fig. Ic,f). To determine the veloc-
ity and vorticity fields, these median-subtracted videos were analysed
witha cross-correlation algorithm using DaVis v.8.0 (LaVision). Image
Pairs were analysed with shifting and overlapping interrogation win-
dows with a size decreasing from 32 x 32 pixels to 16 x 16 pixels. Once
the velocity field was measured, the velocity of the feeding current was
determined by calculating the average velocity across a line the same
size as the oral opening at a distance of 0.25 mm from the oral opening
(Extended Data Fig. 3).

Supplementary Videos 3 and 5 were created using the Flowtrace
Image] plugin from Gilpin et al.””.

Mathematical modelling of feeding flows
Following common practice in modelling sessile microorganisms, we
considered the details of the cilia length, beating frequency and wave-
form of a Stentor’s ciliated ring to be subsumed into a single aver-
aged force that the Stentor exerts on the fluid. Specifically, each
Stentor was modelled by a point force f pointing in the direction
(sing sin 6, —cos @sin6,—cos6) located at position x = (x,y,H). Geo-
metrically, H stands for the length of the Stentor and was kept constant
in all of our simulations. 6 is the inclination angle between the force
and the zaxis, such that 6 = Ocorresponds toa force pointing perpen-
dicular to the x-y plane. @ is the swaying angle between the projection
of the force onto the x-y plane and the yaxis. We set the regularization
parameter ato be 0.2H, which roughly corresponds to the diameter of
the ciliated ring.

The fluid flow generated by a Stentor in the model is governed by
the incompressible Stokes’ equations with zero boundary conditions
at the solid wall z = 0 and at infinity, namely,

—nVu+ Vp =f6(x—-x,), V-u=0, ul,9=0, ul,

where uis the fluid velocity, p the pressure field, 7 the viscosity of the
fluid and 6 the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.

To solve for the fluid flow field u, we use the regularized stokeslet
method proposed by Cortez”. The no-slip wall was realized by adding
an appropriate image system to the stokeslet. The image system was
originally derived by Blake” and was recently reformulated by Gimbu-
tas et al.*°. The regularized version of the image system was studied by
Ainley et al.“’, based on Blake’s formulation. The image system consists
of the regularized counterparts of a stokeslet, a potential dipole, a
Stokes doublet and a rotlet. In general, the fluid velocity at the point x,
induced by a force f located at x, = (%4,,Z,) and its images at
Xo,im = (Xo, Yo: Zo) is given by

Dy (nr) = -3/40(r? + e),

Note there is a typographical mistake in the original paper, which
has been corrected in the above expression. We refer interested read-
ers to the aforementioned papers for the derivation of these expres-
sions. A typical flow field of the model Stentor for the parameters listed
in Extended Data Table 1 is shown in Extended Data Fig. 6. Here, the
stokeslet force is scaled as F = NUH.

We determined the feeding flow velocity as the average flux going
through a circular disc perpendicular to the force and centred at
x — (f/ |f)d, where d = 0.25H was asmall distance away from the mouth.
The diameter of the disc was chosen to be equal to the diameter of the
Stentor’s mouth. The regularization parameter was also chosen to be
equal to the diameter of the Stentor’s mouth.

To analyse the performance ofa pair of stentors, we used a pair of
regularized stokeslets at x, = (0,0,H) and x, = (A, 0,H), respectively.
For the static cases (Fig. 3d,e,g,h), the inclination angles for both sten-
tors were O and the sway angles did not matter. For the dynamic cases
(Fig. 3f,iand Extended Data Fig. 7), the parameters studied were subject

to Gaussian noise of zero mean (o = 0.1n for Oand @, and o = 0.1for A).
To study the asymmetry between the Stentor pair, we kept the strength
of the left Stentor (F,) to be constant and varied the strength of the right
Stentor (F,) so that 0.1 < F,/F, < 10.

Usolitary WaS determined when there was a single Stentor in the
system, and Up, was determined for each Stentor when there were two
stentors placed side by side in the system. All feeding flow velocities
were scaled by the feeding flow velocity of the solitary Stentor1, whose
strength was kept constant.

To analyse the performance of a colony of N stentors, we set the
swaying angle of the ith Stentor to ¢, =2ni/N and placed it at
x; = (Hcos@;,Hsing;,H) such that the stentors were uniformly
placed along a ring of radius H and the projections of their forces
pointed towards the centre of the colony. In the dynamic case,
we added Gaussian noise to the swaying angle, which perturbed the
positions of the stentors along the ring while keeping the forces point-
ing towards the centre. For all colony cases, the stentors had the
same strength.

Since only the orthogonal portion of the flowfields in the region between the
two vortices reaches the oral opening and can be productively filtered for prey,
only the velocity component normal to the oral opening, Useeding (thick black
arrow), is taken as a measure of the feeding current. Due to mixing between
tracer and cilia movements, feeding current velocities were measured 0.25 mm
from the oral opening to prevent contamination of the PIV analysis due to its

inability to separate tracer movements from ciliary beating. Feeding current
(Uyeeaing) for each individual in a pair or alone was determined by calculating the
average velocity across a line the size of the oral opening of each individual. Thin
black arrows denote the flow streamlines. Thin double-headed arrow denotes
separation between the two Stentors. Thick arrow denotes the flow directed

Statistics

For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.

n/a | Confirmed

The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement

x A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly

x The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided
Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

A description of all covariates tested

A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons

A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient)
AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted
Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings

For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes

Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated

Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.

Sample size Samples for the empirical measurement of flow fields were based on individual Stentors of variable size and flow speeds. Due to the inherent
differences between individuals and the variable inter-individual distances in a dynamically moving colony, replication of pre-determined
intervals was not an appropriate statistical approach to describe these interactions. Instead, we used regression analysis to measure
continuous variation in flows accompanying the dynamic variations between individuals and their relative positions. For this approach, we
replicated the patterns and used analysis of covariance between significant regressions to evaluate the empirical patterns (e.g. Fig 2d). Sample
collection was sufficient to result in statistically significant results both within and between cases.

Data exclusions No Stentor data that we collected was excluded from analysis.

Replication All experiments presented in the manuscript were repeated at least three times. Replication yielded successfully replicable patterns as
demonstrated by similar regression slopes for flow speed vs inter-Stentor distances.

Randomization __ Individual Stentors possessed variable flow speeds and the distances between individuals varied dynamically during the course of
measurement. Hence, the dynamic nature of the system being measured did not necessitate further design randomization.

Blinding Blinding involves ensuring that researchers collecting and analyzing data are unaware of the treatment or experimental group of the samples

to prevent bias. In this study, blinding was implemented wherever possible during data analysis to maintain objectivity. Given the nature of
the experimental system, certain aspects of blinding were not applicable
