The water contents of the lunar interior record important clues for understanding the
formation and subsequent thermochemical evolution of the Moon’. The Chang’e-6
(CE6) mission returned samples from the South Pole-Aitken impact basin of the lunar
farside? *, providing an opportunity to study the water contents of the farside mantle.
Here we report the water abundances and hydrogen isotope compositions of apatite
and melt inclusions from CE6 mare basalt, derived from partial melting of the lunar
mantle. The parent magma of CE6 mare basalt is estimated to have a water abundance
of 15-168 pg g' witha SD value of -123 + 167%o. Our estimate of water abundance of
1-1.5 pg g ‘for the mantle source indicates that the farside mantle is potentially drier
than its nearside counterpart. This contrast thus suggests that the distribution of
water in the interior of the Moon may exhibit a hemispheric dichotomy similar to
numerous surface features’. The new estimate for the lunar farside mantle represents
alandmark for estimating the water abundance of the bulk silicate Moon, providing

critical constraints on the giant impact origin hypothesis° * and the subsequent
evolution of the Moon for which the role of water is central’”.

Water abundance in the lunar mantle provides insights into the giant
impact formation models for the Moon® ‘and playsa crucial roleinthe
crystallization of the lunar magma ocean" and subsequent magma-
tism and long-lived volcanism”. In the past two decades, substantial
advances in secondary ion mass spectrometry have improved our
knowledge of water in the lunar mantle, causing a shift from the once
traditional ‘bone dry’ concept’ toa relatively ‘wet’ Moon”. Extensive
studies of various lunar samples derived from the melting of lunar
mantle have shown a heterogeneous distribution of water in the lunar
interior with abundances ranging from about 1pg g‘to200 pg g!
(refs. 9,15-19). However, most of these lunar water estimates derive
from returned samples from the Procellarum KREEP Terrane on the
nearside of the Moon (Fig. 1). The crust exposed at the surface of the
Procellarum KREEP Terrane notably exhibits a higher thorium (Th)
abundance than the other two main lunar geochemical provinces,
the Feldspathic Highlands covering most of the Moon and the South
Pole-Aitken (SPA) Basin, the oldest and largest impact basin of the
Moon located on the lunar farside’.

Both Thand water behave like incompatible elements in magmatic
processes, preferring to stay in the melt rather than getting incorpo-
rated in the solidifying phase, potentially suggesting that the lunar
mantle in the Th-poor Feldspathic Highlands and the SPA Basin may
have lower water content. This possibility, if true, could critically inform
the spatiotemporal distribution of water in the mantle of the Moon, as
well as the giant impact formation models* * and subsequent magmatic
evolution histories of the Moon””°. However, little is known about the
water abundance in the mantle beneath the Feldspathic Highlands and
the SPA Basin. On 25 June 2024, Chang’e-6 (CE6), China’s lunar sample
return mission landing within the SPA Basin, successfully returned
the first lunar farside samples? *, providing the samples required to
investigate the water abundance of the farside lunar mantle.

Water in CE6 apatite and melt inclusions

A total of 578 particles varying from 0.1-1.5 mm in size were sieved
and hand-picked from one CE6 soil sample (CE6CO200YJFMOO1 of
5g). Mare basalt fragments account for around 28% of the selected
particles characterized by scanning electron microscopy and electron
probe microanalysis (EPMA; Extended Data Table land Supplementary
Table 1). The mare basalts, derived from the partial melting of lunar
mantle rocks, are the main targets selected for this study. The dominant
hydrous mineral in mare basalts—apatite and entrapped melt hosted by
olivine and ilmenite—were carefully characterized using scanning elec-
tron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. land Supplementary Figs. 1-3)
for further in situ chemical and isotopic analysis of water.

The studied CE6 mare basalt fragments display ophitic, subophitic,
porphyritic and poikilitic textures, mainly composed of pyroxene, pla-
gioclase, ilmenite and silica with minor olivine, mesostasis and sulfide
and trace apatite (Supplementary Fig. 4), similar toa survey conducted
witha large number of lithic clasts (Zhang, Q. W.L. etal., manuscript in
preparation; Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript in preparation). Parallel studies
conducted on the CE6 chronology (Zhang, Q. W.L. etal., manuscriptin
preparation) and petrogenesis (Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript in prepara-
tion) have shown that these low-Ti mare basalts probably derive from
the same lava flow, or at least the same sequence of lava flows. There-
fore, we sum up all the studied clasts to calculate the modal abundance
of apatite (<0.07 vol%; Supplementary Table 2). Most melt inclusions
hosted by olivine and ilmenite display post-entrapment crystalliza-
tion of 31-52% (Extended Data Table 2). The chemical compositions
of pyroxene and plagioclase in CE6 mare basalt fragments are similar
to those from the nearside, such as those of Chang’e-5 (CE5; Extended
Data Figs. 2 and 3). The apatite grains are F-rich, with compositions in
the range of known mare basalts (Extended Data Fig. 4). Two CE6 mare

three melt inclusions were found (Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary

found in ilmenite (Supplementary Fig. 2). Olivine-hosted melt inclu-
sions have notably higher MgO (3.76-16.8 wt%) than ilmenite-hosted
melt inclusions (<0.3 wt% MgO and 9.9-12.8 wt% Al,O,; Extended Data
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3). Tens of apatite grains with sizes of
5-30 pm and several melt inclusions hosted by olivine and ilmenite
from 17 basalt fragments were also measured for their water abundance
and hydrogen isotopic composition.

The CE6 basaltic apatite grains have water abundances ranging from
345+4 pg g' (20) to3,529 +30 pg g | (average 1,511 + 748 pg g1,1s.d.)
with 8D (6D =1,000 * ([D/Hampiel/[D/Htandaral ~ 1), using Vienna stand-
ard mean ocean water as the standard) values ranging from 657 + 72%o
to 974 + 109% (average 826 + 94%o, 1s.d.; Fig. 2 and Extended Data
Table 3). The ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions contain water contents of
2143 pg g ‘to 238 +21 pg g (20), with a wide range of 8D values from
—183 + 261%o to about 1,000%o (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2). By
contrast, the olivine-hosted melt inclusions have water abundances
ranging from 28 + 8 pg g ‘to 46 + 2 pg g ‘with 6D values of -358 + 610%o
to 100 + 474%o (20; Extended Data Table 2). All data were corrected for
cosmic ray spallation using a cosmic ray exposure (CRE) age of 108 mil-
lion years ago and those spots with H,O less than twice the instrument
background were excluded (Methods).

Water in parent melt and mantle source

Two methods were adopted to estimate water abundance in the parent
melt of the CE6 basalts. The first method is based on apatite, which
is the dominant water-bearing phase in lunar magmatic samples”.

boundaries are from ref. 5 and the Th base map is adapted from ref. 45. The sizes
of the circles are scaled to the estimated maximum water abundance’ inthe
mantle source beneath the sampling sites.

The bulk rock of CE6 basalts is estimated to have a water abundance of
1.1+ 0.5 pg g ‘based onan average water abundance of 1,511+ 748 pg g*
(1s.d.; Extended Data Table 3) of apatite and a modal abundance of
~0.07 vol% (Supplementary Table 2). By contrast, apatite grains in
CE6 mare basalts show notably elevated 6D values (657 + 72%o to
974 + 109%o; Extended Data Table 3) compared with the low 6D (aver-
age at -96 + 230%p, 1s.d.; Extended Data Table 3) of olivine-hosted melt
inclusions and the recommended value of -200 + 200% for the lunar
mantle” This difference indicates a notable loss of water by degassing
in the form of H, before the crystallization of apatite under a reduced
oxygen fugacity environment”*>. This observation is consistent with
the much lower hydrogen isotope compositions in mineral-hosted melt
inclusions (Fig. 2). This feature is identical to that of high-Tiand low-Ti
mare basalts collected from the nearside of the Moon (Fig. 2), suggest-
ing that it resulted from a common degassing process incurred during
mare volcanism. Thus, a degassing extent of 97.99-99.35% based on Ray-
leigh fractionation (Methods) yields a water abundance of 55 + 25 pg g*
to168 + 77 pg g'(1s.d.) for the parent melt of CE6 basalts, assuming an
initial 5D value of about -200%» based on the analyses of D-poor and
H,O-rich CE6 melt inclusions hosted by olivine and ilmenite (Methods).
Meanwhile, based on apatite-melt hygrometry'”°”, we estimated the
parent magma to have a water abundance of 76 + 41 pg g ‘(Methods
and Supplementary Table 6). Thus, both calculations on apatite yield
comparable results within uncertainties.

The second method for estimating water in the parent melt uses
the melt entrapped in minerals of CE6 basalts. Two types of mineral
inclusions, hosted by olivine and ilmenite, were measured in this study
(Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2). The analytical results for the melt
inclusions depict an evolutionary pathway of the parent melt of the
CE6 basalts, in which the entrapment of melts in olivine occurred ina

Fig. 2| Water abundance and 5D of melt inclusions and apatite from CE6

water abundances than ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions and apatite, as well as
mostly lower &D values. Most melt inclusions have a lunar mantle-like &D value

values that are unresolvable from those of apatite within analytical uncertainties.

sistent with the crystallization sequence of other mare basalts”s (Fig. 3).
Olivine is the first-crystallized phase in the CE6 basalt and thus its melt
inclusions may preserve the initial hydrogen isotope composition of the
CE6 parental melt. Therefore, olivine-hosted melt inclusions are used
to estimate the water abundance for the parent melt, yielding a range
of 15-22 pg g‘ after correction for post-entrapment crystallization
(Extended Data Table 2). These two methods yield a water abundance
of about 15-168 p1g g for the CE6 basalt parent magma. This estimate
is comparable to some values from some nearside samples (Extended
Data Fig. 6).

The parent melt of CE6 mare basalts originated from the partial
melting of a depleted mantle source, subsequently experienced
fractional crystallization according to the study of its petrogenesis
(Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript in preparation) and potential degassing
during magmatic processes (Fig. 3). Early-formed melt inclusions
hosted by olivine could be more reliable than the late-formed miner-
als and melt (Fig. 3). Thus, olivine-hosted melt inclusions were used
to calculate the water abundance in the lunar farside mantle. Both Ce
and H,0 exhibit similar incompatibilities, whereas Ce is not a volatile
species”, thus the resulting H,O/Ce ratio of the parent melt canserve as
auseful index to estimate water abundance for the mantle source’> ”.
We calculated a H,O/Ce ratio of 0.58-0.85 for the CE6 olivine-hosted
melt inclusions using a bulk Ce abundance of 25.9 pg g! measured in
Zhou, Q. et al. (manuscript in preparation). The mantle source of the
CE6 mare basalt was estimated to have a water abundance of approxi-
mately 1-1.5 pg g' (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7), considering a
Ce content of 1.728 pg g“ for the primitive lunar mantle”. This estimate

may represent an overestimate if considering the ultra-depleted nature
for the mantle source of the CE6 mare basalt (Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript
in preparation). The CE6 estimate represents the first result for the
water abundance of the mantle from the farside of the Moon.

Distribution of lunar mantle water
Awater abundance of 1-1.5 pg g ‘estimated for the mantle source of CE6
basalts plots among the lowest end of the ranges (about 1-200 pg g")
reported from the nearside samples (Fig. 4), suggesting that the mantle
source of CE6 mare basalt is drier than that of most nearside samples.
A potential drier mantle in the farside of the Moon carries important
implications for understanding the distribution of water in the interior
of the Moon. This finding favours a heterogeneous distribution of water
in the lunar mantle, consistent with the dichotomy distribution of Th
concentration on the surface of the Moon’. If the whole farside mantle is
similar to the mantle source of CE6 mare basalts and drier than the near-
side counterpart, then the water abundance for the bulk silicate Moon
may have been overestimated to some extent’. Therefore, a lower
water content in the bulk silicate Moon is expected, yielding a result
more in line with the giant impact formation model of the Moon®*.
The dating ofa large number of CE6 basalt clasts indicates that 99%
of them belong to the local basalt erupted at about 2.8 x 10° years ago
(Zhang, Q. W.L. et al., manuscript in preparation). The spatiotemporal
evolution of water in the lunar mantle indicates that the water abun-
dances may exhibit a spatial hemispheric contrast rather than atempo-
ral trend based on the formation age of the samples (Fig. 4). Ascenario
to explain this lower water content is that the mantle source of CE6

mare basalt was derived from the partial melting of lunar mantle rocks. The
melt aggregates at depth in networks to form the source magma and intrudes
upwards into shallow depths. The ambient rocks are much colder than the hot
melt, resulting in fractional crystallization of the source magma. In certain
circumstances, the residual melt (parent magma of CE6) from the source
magma flowed up to the lunar surface, forming the rocks of CE6 mare basalt.
The water abundances and hydrogen isotopic compositions measured on melt

pathway for water in the parent melt. b, Rare MgO-rich olivine (Fo 45-62 atom%;

basalts was affected to some extent by the SPA giant impact event, which
may have driven the flux of water and other incompatible elements
(Th, K and H,0) enriched in the mantle of the Procellarum KREEP Ter-
rane towards the lunar nearside and became simultaneously depleted
in its hemispheric antipode in the SPA Basin***>. Another potential
interpretation isa vertical distribution of water in the lunar mantle**”.
The CE6 basalt originated from an extremely depleted mantle source,
which may havea deeper depth of melting than most other lunar sam-
ples (Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript in preparation). Lunar mantle could
have relatively less water for earlier and deeper crystallized cumulates
than later and shallower cumulates formed from the lunar magma
ocean because of the gradual enrichment of incompatible elements
in the residual melt**”.

Origin of lunar mantle water

The analyses of olivine- and ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions consist-
ently point to a parent melt of the CE6 basalts that had a 6D value of
—123 + 167%o (1s.d.; Methods). This value is indistinguishable from that
(-200 + 200%o) derived from nearside samples’**° within analytical
uncertainties, suggesting that the mantle of the Moon could havea
relatively homogeneous hydrogen isotopic composition, which does
not showa spatiotemporal variation. This uniform hydrogen isotopic

of water when the ambient pressure is inadequate to trap the water dissolving

water concentration and 8D (Fig. 2). d, Apatite is one of the last-crystallized
minerals in CE6 basalts, recording notable higher 8D values than olivine-hosted
melt inclusions. Some residual melt from which apatite crystallized may have

lunar samples in this study and previous works’?**° may have been
inherited from the lunar magma ocean from which the mantle rocks
crystallized. Furthermore, the hydrogen isotopic composition of the
farside mantle of the Moon favours a chondritic origin for the indig-
enous water of the Moon*”.

The first water estimate retrieved from the lunar farside indicates
that water abundance in the lunar mantle may exhibit a hemispheric
dichotomy (Fig. 4), similar to the well-known overlying crustal asym-
metry of the nearside and the farside of the Moon’. Given the limited
sampling of the lunar farside, it is still uncertain whether the potential
drier mantle documented here is widespread beneath the SPA Basin
or the whole farside hemisphere. New sample return missions sched-
uled by Artemis* and post-Chang’e programs“ aim to collect more
samples from the farside of the Moon, thus potentially testing and
further unravelling the extremely heterogeneous distribution of the
abundance of water on the Moon.

Methods

Sample preparation

Five grams of scooped Chang’e-6 (CE6) lunar soil (CE6CO200YJFMOO1)
allocated by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) were used
inthis study. The allocated samples were sieved into two dividers inan
ultraclean room at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS) in Beijing, China. One separate was
>355 jum and the other was <355 pm. Eighty-eight particles >355 pm were
selected and prepared into 7 Sn-Bi polished mounts following the pro-
tocol in ref. 46. The mounts were labelled as CE6CO2, MGPO1-MGP07
(Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Another 490 parti-
cles with grain sizes ranging from 100 pm to 350 um were hand-picked
from the sieved soils. These particles were placed in a tunnel (depth
about 300 pm, width about 400 pm and length about 1.8 mm) of silica
glass cut by low-speed diamond saw (Supplementary Fig. 5). Then the
tunnel was filled up with epoxy. These particles were finally prepared
into 14 polished thick sections labelled as CE6CO2,WGPO1-WGP14
(Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The prepared
sections were cleaned up using anhydrous ethanol before drying at
50 °C ina baking oven. All the mounts were coated with carbon for
petrographic observation, chemical analysis and isotopic analysis.
Statistically, the particles used in this study consist of 163 mare basalt
fragments (28%), 97 monomineralic fragments (17%), 50 agglutinates
(9%), 101 breccias (18%), 52 highlands fragments (9%), 76 impact melt
fragments (13%) and 39 glass beads and fragments (7%) (Extended Data
Table 1). Representative petrography of these components in the CE6
lunar soils is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.

Scanning electron microscopy

Petrographic observations and elemental mapping were carried out
using field emission scanning electron microscopes using the FEI Nova
NanoSEM 450 and the Thermo Fisher Apreo instruments at IGGCAS,
using electron beam currents of 2-3.2 nA and an acceleration voltage
of 15 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) X-ray maps were col-
lected for each basaltic clast to locate P-bearing phases, identical to
the protocol used in the study of CES lunar soils**”“*. The phosphates
were then observed at higher magnification in back-scattered electron
(BSE) images. The modal abundance of apatite from various CE6 basalt
fragments was counted by the exposed surface areas (Supplementary
Table 2). The apatite in the studied samples has a modal abundance of
0.067 vol% calculated from 163 basalt fragments using Image) software
(Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7).

Electron probe microanalysis

The major and minor elemental abundances in phosphates, glassy
melt inclusions and associated minerals (olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase
and ilmenite) were measured using a JEOL JXA-8100 electron probe
microanalyser at IGGCAS after the NanoSIMS measurements to avoid
possible H loss due to bombardment by the electron beam”. For silicate,
ilmenite and apatite analysis, the operating accelerating voltage was
15 kVand the beam current was 20 nA. The standards used were albite
for Naand Al, diopside for Si, Mg and Ca, magnetite for Fe, bustamite
for Mn, sanidine for K, rutile for Ti, Cr,O, for Cr, NiO for Ni, apatite for
P, tugtupite for Cl and synthetic fluorite for F. The F Ka X-rays were
counted with a LDE1 crystal to avoid drift with time (ref. 50). F and Cl
were measured first to minimize the loss of volatiles by electron beam
irradiation. The counting time for F was 20 s. The detection limits (10)
were 0.01 wt% for K,0, P, F,and Cl; 0.02 wt% for Cr,03, Al,0;,MnO, CaO,
FeO, TiO, and NiO; 0.03 wt% for SiO, and Na,O. For analysis of melt inclu-
sion glass, the accelerating voltage was 15 kV and the beam current was
10 nA, witha beam size of 5 1m in diameter to obtain the composition
of the glass within a melt inclusion. A natural obsidian glass was used
as amonitor. The detection limits for MI were 0.02 wt% for K,O, CaO,
FeO and NiO; 0.03 wt% for SiO,, MgO, Cr,03, Al,O3, MnO and TiO,; and

0.04 wt% for Na,O. The EPMA data obtained for apatite, melt inclu-
sions and the coexisting silicates are listed in Supplementary Table 3.

In situ water abundance and hydrogen isotope analysis

ACAMECA NanoSIMS SOL at IGGCAS was used to measure the hydrogen
isotopes and water abundance of apatite and melt inclusions from
the CE6 basaltic fragments. The samples were loaded in sample hold-
ers together with the standards, and were baked overnight at about
60 °C inthe airlock chamber. The holders were then stored in the Nano-
SIMS vessel chamber to improve the vacuum quality and minimize the
H background*!*, The vacuum pressure in the analysis chamber was
2.1x10™ torr to 3.0 x 10” torr during analysis facilitated by a liquid
nitrogen cold trap®. Each 15 um x 15 pmanalysis area was pre-sputtered
for 2 min witha Cs‘ ion beam current of 5 nA to remove the surface coat-
ing and potential contamination. A 4 um x 4 pm region of interest on
targets was selected for analysis. The secondary anions'H ,’D’,C- and
180” were simultaneously counted by electron multipliers from the
central 3 jum x 3 pm areas using the electronic gate technique of Nano-
SIMS (about 50% blanking). The ion beam current (Fco) was around
0.5 nA for analysis with a beam size of about 500 nm in diameter. The
charging effect on the surface of the samples was compensated by an
electron gun during analysis. More details are provided in refs. 52,54.

Aseries of apatite and glass standards were used for calibrating the
water abundances and hydrogen isotopes of the samples: Durango
apatite (H,O = 0.0478 wt% and 6D = -120 + 5%v) (refs. 16,55) and Kov-
dor apatite (H,O = 0.98 + 0.07 wt% and &D = -66 + 21%v) (ref. 56), the
SWIFT MORB glass (H,O = 0.258 wt% and 6D = -73 + 2%o), and two
basaltic glasses, ALV-519-4-1(H,O = 0.17 wt%) (ref. 51) and ALV-1833-11
(H,O = 1.2 wt%) (ref. 51) (Supplementary Table 4). The water content
calibration lines established on apatite and glass standards were used
for calibrating the samples (Extended Data Fig. 7). Instrument mass
fractionation (IMF) on hydrogen isotopic composition are the same
between apatite and silicate glass within analytical uncertainties
(Extended Data Fig. 7). Instrumental mass fractionation on Hisotopic
compositions of both apatite and melt inclusions were conducted
using the Kovdor apatite standard and monitored by analysing both
the Durango apatite and SWIFT MORB glass standards during the
whole analytical session (Extended Data Fig. 7). Hydrogen isotopic
compositions are given using the delta notation, 8D = ((D/H) sampie/
(D/H)smow) ~ 1) x 1,000%o, where SMOW is the standard mean ocean
water with a D/H ratio of 1.5576 x 10°* (ref. 57).

The instrument H background was monitored by standards of San
Carlos olivine®’ (H,O = 1.4 pg g") and a synthetic anhydrous quartz
glass Suprasil 3001 (personal communication with Erik Hauri). The H
background correction of ref. 59 was used, which follows the relation-
ship: H/Oyg= (Heounts ~ Hog)/Ocounts ANd D/Hypeasurea = (Uf) * D/Harye +P
D/H,,, wherefis the proportion of H emitted from the instrumental back-
ground. Owing to the inadequate baking and storing time in the instru-
ment, the first 2 days havea slightly higher instrument background at
26-53 ug g' (D/Hyg was (1.40 + 0.25) x 10° to (1.13 + 0.41) x 10*and Hyg
was 1546 + 266 counts per second (cps) to 786 + 81 cps (Supplementary
Table 4). The instrument H,O background was about 10 pg g' (D/Hig
was (1.19 + 0.26) x 10 to (1.14 + 0.49) x 10 and H,, was 374 + 170 cps
to 311+ 37 cps) in the following days (Supplementary Table 4). After
background subtraction, the water abundances of apatite and melt
inclusions were quantified by the slope of the calibration line (Extended
Data Fig. 7), which was determined by measuring apatite and glass
standards.

All data are reported with their 20 uncertainties that include repro-
ducibility of D/H measurements on the reference materials, uncertainty
of H,O background subtraction, internal precision on each analysis
and uncertainty of corrections of spallation effects (Supplementary
Table 5). The raw measured D/H ratios were corrected for the back-
ground, followed by IMF and spallation in sequence (Supplementary
Table 5).

Correction of water abundances and D/H ratios for spallation
effects

The measured D/H ratios have been corrected for the potential effects
of spallation by CRE, using a D production rate of 2.17 x 10°” mol D/g/
Ma (ref. 60) for melt inclusions and 9.20 x 10° mol D/g/Ma (ref. 61) for
apatite, where Ma signifies millions of years ago. The correction errors
induced by D spallation are around 50% for &D and negligible for water
content”. The CRE age for the CE6 lunar soils derives froma cosmogenic
INe age of 146 + 27 Ma(7,,; Zhang, X. et al., manuscript in preparation),
which was converted to an exposure age (7¢a_) of 108 + 20 Mausing an
empirical relationship (73, = 1.35 x Tg) between 72, and T-,; based on
the study of Apollo samples“. An uncertainty of 50% (20) in DandH
production rates raised by the spallation process was combined to cal-
culate its contribution to the 6D errors (ref. 42; Supplementary Table 5).

Petrography of CE6 mare basalt

Approximately 28% of the lithic clasts ina total of 578 fragments studied
inthis work are mare basalt fragments (Supplementary Table 1), which
display subophitic, poikilitic and porphyritic textures (Supplementary
Fig. 4), similar to those in Zhang, Q. W. L. et al. (manuscript in prepa-
ration) and Zhou, Q. et al. (manuscript in preparation). Lath-shaped
plagioclase in the basalts exhibits sharp boundaries, whereas pyroxene
is anhedral with compositional zonation in BSE images (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). These basalt fragments are mainly composed of pyroxene,
plagioclase and ilmenite with minor Si-K-rich mesostasis, fayalite and
troilite, and trace apatite, merrillite, tranquillityite and baddeleyite
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Olivine is very rare and absent in most CE6
mare basalt except two basalt fragments (CE6CO2,WGPO9,G17 and
CE6C02,WGP14,G3), as shown in this study and other parallel stud-
ies (Zhang, Q. W.L. et al., manuscript in preparation; Zhou, Q. et al.,
manuscript in preparation). These two olivine grains have several
melt inclusions with diameters of about 5—SO pum (Extended Data
Fig. land Supplementary Fig. 1). Melt inclusions have experienced
post-entrapment crystallization (31-52%) (Extended Data Fig. 1,
Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). IImenite intergrows
with plagioclase but has a smaller size and irregular edge, occurring
as laths partially enclosed by pyroxene (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nine
melt inclusions in ilmenite were identified in 7 CE6 mare basalt frag-
ments with diameters mostly less than 30 ppm (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions have experienced post-entrapment
crystallization (O-31%) (Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary
Fig. 2). Phosphorus- and zirconium-bearing minerals mainly occur in
the fine-grained interstitial areas. Several apatite grains are observable
in the margins of plagioclase and pyroxene (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Most apatite grains have euhedral shape and rare ones are lath-shaped
(Supplementary Fig. 3). CE6 mare basalts have notably less apatite
(0.067 vol%; Supplementary Table 2) than CES basalts (0.4 vol%) (ref. 9).
Meanwhile, apatite grains in CE6 mare basalt fragments have smaller
sizes (mostly <5 pm; Supplementary Fig. 3).

Mineral chemistry of CE6 mare basalt

Plagioclase from CE6 basalt clasts is relatively homogeneous with
acomposition of Anz; > 9 sADs3-2910T 91-50 (Extended Data Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 3). The pyroxene displays compositional zona-
tion from Mg-rich cores (Enq) 1-56,1W0o3-38.1FS297-49,5) to Fe-rich rims
(Eng 3-259 W0y, 6-473FS47.8-876) (Extended Data Fig. 2and Supplementary
Table 3). IImenite shows no chemical difference between various basalt
fragments, containing about 52.9 wt% TiO, and about 46.2 wt% FeO,
with minor other elements (Supplementary Table 3). Most CE6 basalt
fragments contain trace fayalite (Mg# <1). Two relatively large olivine
grains having melt inclusions identified in this study are quite homo-
geneous in chemistry with average Mg# of 49.3 + 2.7 and 59.1 + 2.2 (lo,
n=5; Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). Interstitial
mesostasis is SiO,-rich (65.2-76.9 wt%) and K,O-rich (2.40-7.65 wt%;

Supplementary Table 3). Olivine- and ilmenite-hosted melt inclu-
sions have 38.0-79.9 wt% SiO), 0.61-7.13 wt% TiO, 5.43-17.5 wt% Al,O3,
0.68-15.6 wt% CaO and 1.44-33.1 wt% FeO (Extended Data Fig. 5 and
Extended Data Table 3). Concentrations of MgO in olivine-hosted melt
inclusions range from 3.76 wt% to 16.8 wt%, whereas those of melt inclu-
sions inilmenite are less than 0.30 wt%. Melt inclusions in olivine have
lower SiO, contents (38.0-60.6 wt%) compared with ilmenite-hosted
ones (44.5-79.9 wt%), indicating an earlier entrapment for the former.
Apatite grains in this study contain 2.54-4.08 wt% F and 0.09-0.43 wt%
Cl (Supplementary Table 3), close to the fluorapatite end-member in
the F-Cl-OH ternary diagram (Extended Data Fig. 4). The evaluated OH
contents of apatite range from 0 wt% to 0.22 wt%, assuming the volatile
site only contains F, Cl and OH. Apatite grains in CE6 mare basalt frag-
ments are usually less than 5 ppm, rendering it unavoidable to sample
some surrounding minerals during EPMA and yielding an EPMA total
usually less than 98 wt% (Supplementary Table 3).

Estimate of water abundance for the parent melt of CE6 mare
basalt

Melt inclusions. Melt inclusions are trapped melt in the minerals during
crystallization of the parent melt. Three melt inclusions were identified
in olivine from two CE6 mare basalt fragments (CE6CO2,WGP09,G17
and CE6C02,WGP14,G3; Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary
Fig. 1). These olivine-hosted melt inclusions havea water abundance of
28-46 pg ¢", slightly higher than theinstrument background, with large
variation in 6D values (-358 + 610% to 100 + 474%o) after correction of
spallation effects (Extended Data Table 2). The correction of spalla-
tion can markedly affect 6D for those samples with water abundances
<50 pg g" (ref. 42). The hydrogen isotopic compositions for analy-
ses with H,O < 20 pg g' may not be reliable because of the extremely
low measured D counts’. Thus, those spots with H,O < 20 pg g? (that
is, two times the instrument background) are not discussed or used
in deriving the water abundance for the parent magma and for the
mantle source (Extended Data Table 2). An average 5D of -96 + 230%o
(1s.d.) in olivine-hosted Mls is comparable to some early trapped melt
hosted by ilmenite, which have water abundances of 153-184 pg g*
and 8D values of -183%o to -140%o with an average value of -158 + 23%o
(1s.d.; Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 2). The low-8D nature of the
melt inclusions hosted by olivine and by early-formed ilmenite are
comparable to the mantle 6D value (-200 + 200%o) recommended
in previous studies’?*°, indicating that these Mls plausibly repre-
sent the parent melt in the terms of water abundance and hydrogen
isotope signature. This prediction is also supported by the high MgO
content in olivine-hosted melt inclusions compared with previous
work232022,

The host olivine grains of melt inclusions have forsterite content of
45.0-61.6 atom% (Supplementary Table 3), indicative of early precipita-
tion phases crystallized from the parent melt of the CE6 mare basalt.
In comparison, CE6 mare basalt has a slightly lower bulk Tiabundance
(4.2 wt%) (Zhou, Q. et al., manuscript in preparation) than that of CES
(5.3 wt%) (ref. 63), which would result in the late precipitation of ilmen-
ite from the parent melt as shown by modelling”’. A gap in water abun-
dance between olivine- and ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions could be
the result of the crystallization sequence (Fig. 2). It is also noted that
some ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions have comparable values to apa-
tite, suggesting a late entrapment probably accompanying the onset
of apatite at a quite late crystallization stage. Therefore, we provide an
illustration diagram depicting the potential evolutionary pathways of
magmatic water for CE6 mare basalt (Fig. 3). Finally, the 6D-poor spots
of olivine-hosted melt inclusions are regarded as a target for estimating
the water abundance of the parent melt. We estimate a water abundance
of 15-22 pg g ‘for the parent melt of the CE6 mare basalt based on the
olivine-hosted melt inclusions (Extended Data Table 2). Excluding the
notable high 6D ilmenite-hosted melt inclusions probably formed
accompanying apatite in the late crystallization stages, we estimate the

parent melt of the CE6 mare basalt as having a 6D value of -123 + 167%o
(1s.d.) (Extended Data Table 2).

Apatite. Apatite is the major OH-bearing phase in lunar igneous rocks'.
Amodal abundance and an average water abundance of apatite were
used to quantify water in bulk CE6 basalts. Statistically assessed
using the surface areas of apatite grains in all basaltic clast, the modal
abundance of apatite in CE6 basalts is found to be less than 0.07 vol%
(Supplementary Table 2). The average water content and 6D value
of the CE6 apatite measured by NanoSIMS 50L are 1,511 + 748 pg g!
and 826 + 94%o (1s.d., n = 16), respectively (Extended Data Table 3).
Hence, the water abundance of the bulk CE6 basalt is 1.1+ 0.5 pg g*
(1s.d.). Apatite is a late-crystallizing mineral in mare basalts; its notably
higher 6D values (826 + 94%o) than the low-6D (-200 + 200%o) nature of
lunar mantle*??“° and low 6D of CE6 melt inclusions indicate strong
degassing and loss of water in the form of H, (refs. 24,25). The hydro-
gen isotope fractionation during volatile loss into a vacuum is given
by a? = M,/M,, where M, and M, are the masses of the volatile phase
isotopologues. The change of the isotopic composition of H during
volatile loss by Rayleigh fractionation is given by R=R, xf», where
R,and Rare the initial and final D/H ratios for a fraction fof remaining
hydrogen. Degassing of H, (M, = 2 for H, and M, = 3 for HD) yields ana
value of about 0.8165 (ref. 25). Degassing modelling indicates that the
crystallization of apatite grains in CE6 mare basalt started at the time
when 97.99-99.35% of initial water in the parent melt has been degassed.
After degassing loss correction, the water abundance of the parent melt
is about 55 + 25 pg g ‘to 168 +77 pg g ‘(1s.d.).

In another viable approach’”°”, the authors have developed
apatite-based melt hygrometry methodologies, to estimate parent
magma water abundance using apatite. These methods are designed
to estimate parent melt water abundances from apatite regardless of
how much H-degassing has occurred after apatite crystallization. The
measured F and H,O abundance in apatite from each fragment was used
to derive the parental melt H,O, using a 0.07 vol% modal abundance of
apatite (Supplementary Table 2). The results yield H,O abundance of
59-99 pg g ‘for the parental magma (Supplementary Table 6), plotting
within the approximately 55-168 pg grange of the other method pre-
sented earlier. Considering the early entrapment of olivine-hosted melt
inclusions”, these targets were used to estimate the water abundance
for the mantle source.
