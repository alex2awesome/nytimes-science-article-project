Buzzing boundaries: tiny caterpillars vibrate to defend leaf

tip territories

ABSTRACT

Territorial displays include some of the most elaborate behaviours in
the animal kingdom. In this study, we investigated the territorial
behaviour and vibratory signalling of neonate warty birch caterpillars
(Falcaria bilineata; Lepidoptera: Drepanidae), which reside solitarily
on birch leaves and defend the leaf tip. Upon hatching, these tiny
caterpillars — no larger than 2 mm — seek out and establish a small
solitary territory (~1 cm wide) at the leaf tip, where they lay silk mats,
feed and advertise their presence by producing multicomponent
vibratory signals — buzz scrapes and drums. When a conspecific
neonate (intruder) is introduced to a leaf occupied by a resident, the
resident increases its signalling rate up to four times that when
undisturbed, and even more — up to 14 times — if the intruder enters
the territory. Intruders rarely manage to take over the resident's
defended space, with most confrontations (71%) ending in the
resident maintaining control. Residents signal significantly more than
intruders at all stages of the contest. If physical contact occurs,
residents flee by dropping from the leaf by a silk thread. This results in
territorial contests that involve no physical aggression, relying entirely
on vibratory communication. These vibratory displays most likely
function to establish spacing between conspecifics on a tree branch,
but these complex signals may also function to exclude other
members of the vibratory community by mimicking something
dangerous, such as a jumping spider.

INTRODUCTION

Territorial behaviour is widespread throughout the animal kingdom
and has been studied extensively in vertebrates and invertebrates
(Baker, 1983; Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998; Fitzpatrick and
Wellington, 1983; Wilson, 2000). A territory is defined as ‘an area
occupied more or less exclusively by animals or groups of animals
by means of repulsion through overt aggression or advertisement”
(Wilson, 2000). Most reported examples of territorial behaviour
involve males defending resources related to reproduction. Territory
holders usually advertise their space with chemicals or sounds to
deter intruders, but if a resident is challenged, contests can escalate

to physical aggression, sometimes resulting in death. Although
these are the most typical territorial scenarios reported, many
interesting exceptions are not well studied (Baker, 1983; Fitzpatrick
and Wellington, 1983; Wilson, 2000). Here, we report on one of those
exceptions — a caterpillar no larger than 2 mm, that vehemently
defends the tip of a leaf against intruders using complex leaf-borne
vibrations.

The warty birch caterpillar of the two-lined hooktip moth
(Falcaria bilineata; Lepidoptera: Drepanidae) occurs across North
America, feeding on birch (Betula spp.; Betulaceae) and alder
(Alnus spp.; Betulaceae) leaves (Rose and Lindquist, 1997; Wagner,
2010). These caterpillars are known for their warty appearance and
their arched, dragon-like resting stance (Mosher, 1917; Wagner,
2010), as well as their ability to produce vibrations (Bowen et al.,
2008). The moths lay eggs in rows on twigs and leaves of host trees
(Bowen et al., 2008; Dyar, 1894). Upon hatching, the tiny neonates
(0.5 to 2mm) wander on the leaf surface, where they are highly
vulnerable owing to their lack of protective adaptations such as shelter
building, group living or leaf mining (Bowen et al., 2008; Dyar, 1894;
L.M.T., unpublished observations), which are characteristic of other
neonate caterpillars (see Zalucki et al., 2002). A previous study
reported anecdotally that early instar F: bilineata produced vibrations
and tended to reside solitarily on leaves, suggesting that these larvae
may be territorial (Bowen et al., 2008), although this hypothesis was
not tested.

In this study, we tested two hypotheses. First, that neonate warty
birch caterpillars are territorial. We predicted that: (i) caterpillars
occupy an exclusive area on the leaf; (ii) undisturbed caterpillars on
this space will occasionally advertise; (iii) when confronted with
a conspecific, the resident usually retains the space (i.e. exhibits
resource holding power); and (iv) sometimes intruders take over the
space (Baker, 1983; Fitzpatrick and Wellington, 1983; Wilson,
2000). Second, that vibratory signalling functions in territorial
contests. We predicted that: (i) caterpillars produce vibratory signals
(.e. vibrations distinct from those produced by crawling or chewing);
(ii) signalling rates of an established resident escalate as an intruder
approaches; (iii) residents signal more than intruders; and (iv) if an
intruder takes over the territory, then it begins to signal (Bradbury and
Vehrencamp, 1998; Wilson, 2000). These hypotheses were tested by
assessing and characterizing territorial behaviours, and by staging
encounters between established residents and conspecific intruders.
Why these tiny caterpillars might defend leaf tips, and how complex
vibrations function to fend off intruders, are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Insects

Caterpillars of Falcaria bilineata (Packard 1864) were reared from
eggs laid by wild-caught female moths collected at ultraviolet-
emitting lights, including mercury vapour bulbs, 15 W ultraviolet
collecting lights and LepiLED Maxi Switch LEDs (Brehm, 2017).
Moths were collected from the Queen’s University Biology Station

(Chaffey’s Lock, ON, Canada, 44.5788°N, 76.3195°W), and
other regions near Ottawa, ON, Canada (45.4215°N, 75.6972°W)
between May and June 2023, as well as from Howe Bay (Prince
Edward Island, Canada, 46.302770°N, 62.408695°W) in August
2009. Moths laid eggs on different substrates (e.g. leaves, paper,
twigs) in glass or screened enclosures, and upon hatching, neonate
larvae were transferred to leaves on cuttings of paper birch (Betula
papyrifera; Betulaceae) and maintained in jars or plastic bins until
used in experiments. Only the first instars (1-3 days old) were used
in experiments.

Choosing a leaf location

We first assessed whether larvae show a preference for specific leaf
locations. To do this, a total of 59 replicates were conducted. Each
replicate involved a single birch leaf (6-9 cm longx4—6 cm wide) on
a birch twig inserted into a hole in the lid of a water-filled plastic vial.
Each vial was then enclosed within a plastic container lined with

moistened paper towels. One neonate larva (<24 h after hatching) was
carefully transferred using a fine-tipped paintbrush to the centre and
adaxial side of the leaf. After an interval of 12-24h, leaves were
inspected to document where the larva was established, as indicated
by the presence of a feeding scar and a silk mat. Leaf location
preferences were scored as one of four locations (base, middle,
lateral or tip) and side of the leaf (abaxial or adaxial) (see Fig. 1).
Preference for leaf location was evaluated using a chi-square test,
which ascertained whether the distribution of established locations
significantly deviated from the expected occurrence of 25%.

Territorial behaviour

Vibroacoustic and video recordings were conducted on established
individual residents to describe and delineate the home range area,
and to characterize how they behaved in this space before and after
introducing a conspecific intruder to the leaf. These recordings were
also used to identify and characterize vibratory signals and events. A

total of 40 videos were analyzed, and subsets of these videos were
used to address different questions. How videos and corresponding
.wav files were sampled and analyzed to address different questions
are reported below.

Recording setup

Simultaneous video and vibration recordings were conducted to study
larval territorial behaviours. A plastic vial with a twig containing a
single birch leaf with one established larva (as described above) was
clamped to a sturdy stand positioned on an antivibration table.
Vibratory signals were recorded from the leaf surface using a laser
Doppler vibrometer (PVD-100, Polytec Inc., Waldbronn, Baden-
Wiirttemberg, Germany) (velocity 20 mm s~!; high pass filter off:
low pass filter 20 kHz) with the laser beam focused on reflective tape
(5.5 mm diameter) affixed to the upper (adaxial) leaf surface 2-3 cm
from the established caterpillar. Forty trials were videotaped using a
camcorder (Canon XA11 or Canon Vixia HF G20, or Sony HDR-
XR520V Handycam) equipped with a macro close-up lens (Raynox
DCR-250 or DCR-100, Yoshida Industry Co., Tokyo, Japan) and
coupled with the laser vibrometer analogue output connected to the
microphone port. In a subset of trials, the laser analogue was also
connected to a data recorder (Marantz PMD 671, Marantz Corp.,
Kanagawa, Japan) set to a sampling rate of 48 kHz. All trials were
performed within an acoustic chamber (C-14A MR, Eckel Industries
Ltd, Cambridge, MA, USA).

Vibratory signals

Vibratory signals were identified and characterized in two stages.
First, close-up videos (+laser vibrometry) of first instar larvae in
different behavioural contexts (e.g. undisturbed or in the presence of
conspecific; see Results) were watched at reduced playback speed,
while listening with headphones, to correlate vibrations with body
movements. Vibrations were designated as ‘signals’ if they were
generated by specialized body movements (i.e. did not occur
incidentally because of activities such as chewing or crawling) and
had a high signal-to-noise ratio. In total, ~29 h of video footage was
reviewed. Once vibrations were categorized as signals, each signal
type was analyzed for temporal and spectral characteristics based on a
subset of eight audio files in .wav format (~7 h of recordings) from
different undisturbed individuals. Initial temporal analysis indicated
that signals are often produced in bouts, defined as a series of signals
separated by at least 1 s of inactivity. Four temporal characteristics
were measured altogether: (i) bout duration, (ii) total number of
signals within a bout, (iii) number of each signal type within a bout
and (iv) signal duration. The peak frequency was obtained for each
signal after applying a FFT (sampling frequency: 48,000; window
type: Hanning; window size: 1024; overlap: 50). Data were collected
by selecting between three and six bouts from eight individuals,
resulting in a total of 34 bouts, and 212 different signals (162 buzz
scrapes and 50 drums). Acoustic analyses were performed using the
software Audacity® (version 3.6.1; https://audacityteam.org/).

Territory boundaries and movement patterns

Video recordings of established larvae were reviewed to describe
the boundaries of the home range (an area that an animal habitually
patrols), which is used as a proxy for territory (see Wilson,
2000), and activity patterns within this space. We tracked an
individual’s movements frame-by-frame using idtracker.ai (version
5.2.11) (Romero-Ferrero et al., 2019) running within the Anaconda
Software Platform (version 2-2.4.0; https://anaconda.com), which
provides the necessary environment for the tool. A total of 34 videos
of individuals were used for home range measurements. However,

only videos with an identification accuracy greater than 95% were
included in the tracking analysis to ensure reliable tracking (n=18
videos). From the selected videos, we identified and measured the
core area used by the caterpillar where they fed, rested, signalled and
laid silk. Measurements were made using CorelDraw 2021 (Corel,
Ottawa, ON, Canada). The trajectory obtained from the videos was
imported into R software (version 4.3.3; https://www.R-project.org/)
running in the RStudio interface (version 2023.12.1+402; http://
www.rstudio.com/). We generated the caterpillar pathways using the
geom_path function from the ggplot2 package, using a screenshot
from the video as a background layer. All video analysis procedures
were performed on a computer running Windows 11 Pro 64-bit with
an Intel® Core i7-9750H CPU (2.60 GHzx12), 32 GB RAM and an
NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1660 Ti Max-Q GPU.

Territorial encounters
To assess territorial behaviour, 18 encounters were staged between a
resident and a conspecific intruder. For each trial, an established first
instar larva (the resident) was set up in the recording apparatus (see
‘Recording setup’, above) and recorded undisturbed for 30 min.
Then, a conspecific first instar larva (the intruder) randomly selected
from the rearing container was carefully placed, using a fine-tipped
paintbrush, 3—5 cm from the resident on its territory. Both larvae were
then recorded for an additional 30 min. Video recordings were
reviewed at reduced playback speed to mark various behaviours
including signalling events and locations of residents and intruders
relative to the territory. A ‘win’ was defined as the individual
occupying the territory at the conclusion of the trial. Time sequenced
files were created using JWatcher Video (version 1.0; https:/\www.
jwatcher.ucla.edu/), and data files from JWatcher were exported to
Microsoft Excel. To test whether the signalling rates of a resident
escalate as an intruder approaches, we assessed the types and rates of
signalling by the contestants across three contexts: (i) undisturbed
resident (the resident during the 30 min prior to adding the intruder),
(ii) intruder on leaf but outside territory (when the intruder was on the
leaf but not within the boundary of the resident’s territory) and (iii)
intruder on resident’s territory (when the intruder had crossed the
territory boundary of the resident). Signalling rates were calculated
for each trial by dividing the total number of vibratory signals
(buzzes+drums) by the total recording duration in each trial. This
calculation was performed for each individual (resident or intruder)
within each context (undisturbed, n=18; intruder on a leaf, n=13; or
intruder in resident territory, n=8). The resident signalling rates were
analyzed using a generalized linear model (GLM) with deviance
analysis, incorporating sample-size-based weights to account for the
differing number of replicates across contexts. Residual normality
and homoscedasticity were assessed using the DHARMa package.
To compare whether residents signal more than intruders, we used the
paired ¢-test to evaluate signalling rates between residents and
intruders within the same context. Finally, we assessed resource
holding power by scoring the number of wins for each individual
(‘resident’ and ‘intruder’). To evaluate the relationship between
individual identity and win probability, we fitted a binomial GLM.
Model diagnostics were checked using the DHARMa package. All
analyses were conducted in R software (version 4.3.3; https://www.R-
project.org/) within the RStudio interface (version 2023.12.1+402;
http://www.rstudio.com/).

leaf regions is different than expected by chance (y7=126.83, d.f.=3,
P<0.0001), with the highest preference for the leaf tip (88.14%,
n=52/59), then the lateral edges (10.17%, n=6/59) and the middle
(1.69%, n=1/59). No individuals were established at the leaf base
(Fig. 1). Also, the majority (93.22%, n=55/59) were established on
the adaxial surface of the leaf (y?=44.085, d.f.=1, P<0.0001).
Territories of established residents on leaf tips were defined based
on movement patterns. Resident movements were tracked for 18
individuals over a total time period of 8 h (+28 min per video). The
core area of use (8.02+1.25 mm”) (n=18) is where larvae typically
eat, rest and signal (Fig. 1; Movie 1). Notably, undisturbed residents
did not wander on the leaf beyond the feeding scar, and based on this,
territory boundaries were delineated as extending from the leaf tip to
the proximal edge of the feeding scar (Fig. 1; Movie 1). The feeding
scar, resulting from leaf skeletonization, is located at a distance of
11.56+0.70 mm (n=34) from the distal edge of the leaf tip. This area
from the feeding scar to the leaf tip as well as the leaf edges is covered
by a silk mat, with no shelter. The very tip of the leaf was never
consumed and remained green (n=35/35) (Figs 1-3; Movies | and 3).

Vibratory signals

First instar caterpillars produce two distinct vibratory signals: drums
and buzz scrapes (Fig. 2; Movie 2). Drums are generated when the
anterior body rapidly strikes the leaf surface (Fig. 2). It was not

always possible to confirm which part(s) of the body (head, thorax
or both) struck the leaf, as the movement sequence could not be
resolved with our video frame rate (29.97 frames s~') (Movie 2).
Drums can occur on their own, but most often occur in combination
with buzz scrapes (Fig. 2; Movie 2). Buzz scrapes are
multicomponent signals involving simultaneous body tremulation,
stridulation, and often percussion (from the inclusion of the drums
during the buzz scrapes) (Fig. 2; Movie 2). A buzz scrape begins
with the caterpillar head+thorax and terminal anal segments
(A7-A10) elevated off the leaf surface (Fig. 2; Movie 2). The
vibration begins with a low amplitude, vertical tremulation of the
head+thorax accompanied by the anal segment being lowered and
dragged anteriorly across the leaf surface. This type of stridulation
involves a pair of oar-shaped setae (posterior proctal, PP1) on the
terminal abdominal segment that are specialized for generating
vibrations in some Drepanoidea (Scott et al., 2010a,b; Yack et al.,
2001) (Fig. 2). At the end of the buzz scrapes, the head and anal
segments are raised to return to the resting posture. Although the
buzz scrape can occur on its own, one or more drums often occur
simultaneously during the buzz scrapes. Vibratory signals are often
produced in bouts, comprising a rapid succession of buzz scrapes
and terminating with one or more isolated drums (Fig. 2; Movie 2).

Data on signal characteristics were collected using a total of
34 bouts, and 212 different signals (162 buzz scrapes and 50 drums)

Fig. 2. Vibratory signals produced by
neonate Falcaria bilineata caterpillars.

buzz scrape (BS) and drum (D). For
buzz scrapes, the caterpillar begins in
resting position, with only the prolegs in
contact with the leaf. The vibration
begins with a tremulation of the anterior
body, while the anal segment with anal
‘oar’ structures (shown in inset) is
lowered and dragged anteriorly across
the leaf surface. For drums, the anterior
body (head+thorax) rapidly strikes the
leaf surface. (B) Five signalling bouts are
shown in the waveform of the lower

succession of buzz scrapes and drum
signals. The spectrogram (upper panel)

signals (five buzz scrapes followed by a

produced by eight individuals. Drum duration was 48.64+1.21 ms.
Drums were broadband with three prominent peaks at
188.96+13.14, 572.0+22.52 and 1321.77+52.21 Hz. Buzz scrapes
were 243.51+6.82 ms in duration and broadband with three prominent
peaks at 139.10+3.02, 489.41+13.01 and 1011.05+26.25 Hz (Fig. 2;
Movie 2). The duration of signalling bouts was 2.22+0.25 s. Bouts
contained an average of 5.59+0.40 signals (Fig. 2; Movie 2).

Other vibrations recorded during our experiments included a low
amplitude vertical tremulation of the anterior body that may occur
on its own or preceding a buzz scrape, as well as vibrations
incidental to chewing and crawling. These did not meet the criteria
for being ‘signals’ and were not characterized or scored.

Territorial contests

Eighteen encounter trials were conducted to assess the territorial
behaviour F. bilineata caterpillars. During the 30 min prior to
introducing an intruder, undisturbed residents spent most of their
time feeding or resting, and occasionally signalling at a mean rate of
1.64+0.97 signals min~! (n=18) (Fig. 3). When an intruder was
added to the leaf (but was not on the territory) the resident typically
stopped feeding or laying silk, moved to the green part of the leaf tip,
and increased signalling (6.92+1.47 signals min~! (n=13) (Fig. 3;
Movie 3). Overall, resident signalling rates escalated as an intruder
approached (F3,36=15.272, P<0.001). When an intruder entered a
resident’s territory (in 8/18 trials), resident signal rates increased to
24.41+7.05 signals min7! (n=8) (Fig. 3; Movie 3). Intruders also

signalled when on the leaf (1.21+0.69 signals min~!, n=13), and in
those individuals that crossed into the resident’s territory, their
signal rates increased to 2.55+1.42 signals min! (n=8) (Fig. 3).
Overall, residents signalled significantly more than intruders, both
when the intruder was on the leaf (but outside the territory) (~5.7
times more, 3.86, d.f=12, P=0.002) and when the intruder was on
the resident’s territory (9.5 times more, =2.83, d.f=7, P=0.025). No
biting or pushing by either the resident or intruder occurred during
these encounters. However, residents frequently jumped off the leaf
tip and hung on a silk thread, a behaviour known as ‘lifelining’
(Brackenbury, 1996) (Fig. 3, Movie 3). Jumping occurred in 44.4%
of all trials (n=8/18 trials), and always when the intruder approached
the resident and made body contact. Residents never jumped off the
leaf when they were alone. When resident jumping occurred, the
intruder either remained on the territory and began to feed (3/8
trials) or wandered away (5/8 trials).

The outcome of each contest (i.e. who ‘won’ the trial) was
assessed based on which contestant remained on the territory at the
end of the trial (Fig. 3; Movie 3). In 14 out of 18 trials, one of the
contestants occupied the territory at the end of the contest, whereas
in 4 out of 18 trials, neither the resident nor the intruder remained
on the territory, and this was due to the resident hanging on a thread
while the intruder had walked away at the end of the 30 min
recording period. Among the 14 contests where there was a clear
‘winner’, residents secured the territory in 71.42% of contests
(n=10/14), whereas intruders won 28.58% of contests (n=4/14).

Notably, none of the trials (0/18 trials) ended with both individuals
on the territory.

DISCUSSION

Some of the most elaborate behaviours in the animal kingdom occur
during territorial exchanges (Wilson, 2000). Here, we show that tiny
caterpillars, no longer than 2 mm, produce complex multicomponent
vibratory displays while defending a leaf tip. We discuss why neonate
caterpillars would guard a leaf tip, and how complex vibratory
signalling might deter intruders.

The first hypothesis tested in this study was that neonate warty
birch caterpillars are territorial. Key predictions for animal
territoriality are that individuals occupy an exclusive area, that they
defend this area through advertisement and/or physical aggression,
and that usually, the resident wins conflicts, exhibiting resource
holding potential (Baker, 1983; Fitzpatrick and Wellington,
1983; Wilson, 2000). Our results align with these predictions.
Neonate warty birch caterpillars show a strong preference to establish
themselves at the distal tips of birch leaves. They occupy this space
exclusively, where they lay a silk mat, rest, feed and occasionally
advertise by signalling. When confronted with an intruding
conspecific, the resident usually retained the territory (n=10/14),
but occasionally the intruder occupied the territory at the end of the
trial (n=4/14). No trials ended with two individuals settling on the
territory. These results provide compelling evidence for territorial
behaviour against conspecific intruders in neonate caterpillars, and to
the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented instance of an
insect defending a leaf tip.

Why defend a leaf tip? A hallmark of animal territoriality is to gain
access to valuable resources that are in short supply, such as food
(Wilson, 2000). Although leaves on a birch tree are not a limited
resource, the leaf tips in particular may provide nutritive benefits such
as being more tender (e.g. Malishev and Sanson, 2015) or having a
lower density of trichomes. Such traits would be beneficial to neonate
caterpillars that can experience high mortality rates due to plant
defences (Zalucki et al., 2002). At present there is no evidence that
birch leaf tips are more tender or have fewer trichomes than other parts
of the leaf, but this would be interesting to explore. An alternative
hypothesis to explain the selective advantage of residing on a leaf tip
is that this location could facilitate escape from predators. Early instar
of F. bilineata have few antipredator defences that are commonly
employed by other neonate caterpillars (see Zalucki et al., 2002).
They live solitarily on the leaf surface and lack a protective shelter or
other apparent physical defences (Bowen et al., 2008). Our results
show that upon being contacted by an intruding conspecific, a
significant proportion of residents jumped off the leaf tip, yet
remained attached to the leaf by a silk thread. This behaviour,
described as lifeline hanging, occurs when some caterpillar species
become alarmed (Brackenbury, 1996). Most species that employ
lifeline hanging are free-living (Sugiura and Yamazaki, 2006) and
may use this escape mechanism as an alternative to building a
protective silk shelter. We propose that for F. bilineata neonates, the
leaf tip facilitates predator avoidance for a couple of reasons. First,
residing on the leaf tip would allow residents to predict the direction
of a crawling predator such as a spider, lacewing or beetle, which
would approach the leaf from the petiole. Second, leaf tips have been
shown to have higher vibration amplitudes when compared with
other parts of the leaf (Casas et al., 1998; Meyhofer et al., 1994),
which might facilitate escape. The flexibility of the leaf tip could act
as a springboard for jumping, or could amplify the vibrations
resulting from the crawling movements of an approaching predator,
allowing for early detection. Another possible advantage of residing

on a flexible leaf tip is to enhance the amplitude of the resident’s
signal to make the resident appear larger or more dangerous (Wilson,
2000) (see also discussion of this point below). There are few
examples of animal territories that function primarily as escape routes
(Baker, 1983; Fitzpatrick and Wellington, 1983; Wilson, 2000), but
we argue that this is a likely explanation for territoriality in neonate F.
bilineata. To further test how residing on a leaf tip enhances survival,
future experiments could assess the biomechanics of birch leaves,
including the spatial distribution and transmission properties of
vibrations, as well as the survival benefits of residing on the leaf tip in
the presence of natural predators.

The second hypothesis tested in this study was that vibratory
signals function in territorial defence. The functions of animal
territorial signals are to advertise the presence of an owner, define
territorial boundaries and repel intruders (Bradbury and Vehrencamp,
1998). Our results support several key predictions for this hypothesis.
First, undisturbed residents occasionally advertise by stopping
feeding or laying silk, often moving to the very tip of the leaf, and
producing short bouts of signalling. Second, when a conspecific
neonate was placed on the leaf, the resident increased its rate
of signalling, and these rates escalated further when the intruder
crossed the territory boundary. Third, residents signal more than
intruders in all contexts. Interestingly, territorial signalling in
F. bilineata neonates differs from other examples in insects. For
example, in most reported insect territorial systems, signalling often
communicates the ability to fight, with signal escalation resulting in
physical aggression (Baker, 1983). However, our results show that
signal escalation in F- bilineata never results in physical fighting such
as biting, pushing or thrashing. Instead, contests appear to be resolved
by vibratory signalling. This behaviour could reflect a survival
strategy for soft-bodied larvae, where biting could be lethal. Such
non-aggressive territorial interactions might be more widespread
among larvae or other non-weaponized insects, yet have been
underreported in the literature. Moreover, vibratory signalling in the
context of territorial conflicts is not well documented in insects in
general (e.g. Turchen et al., 2022; Virant-Doberlet et al., 2023), with
most territorial insects reported to use visual, chemical or airborne-
sound displays (Baker, 1983; Fitzpatrick and Wellington, 1983).
For small, flightless insects such as caterpillars that are substrate-
bound and lack good vision, vibration-mediated signals may be the
optimal communication modality. In fact, there is a growing number
of examples of larger, late instar (IV,V) caterpillars defending
whole leaves or silk shelters and sometimes incorporating vibratory
signalling [e.g. Drepana arcuata (Drepanidae) (Yack et al., 2001),
Falcaria bilineata (Drepanidae) (Bowen et al., 2008), Oreta rosea
(Drepanidae) (Scott et al., 2010a,b), Tethea or (Drepanidae) (Scott
and Yack, 2012) and Caloptilia serotinella (Gracillariidae) (Fletcher
et al., 2006)]. Overall, our results provide strong support that
territorial defence is mediated by complex vibratory signalling even
in tiny hatchlings. We propose that this form of territorial signalling
may be more common in substrate-bound insects than currently
reported, but overlooked by researchers owing to the lack of
awareness and capability of recording these vibrations.

Recent studies have significantly enhanced our understanding of
vibrational communication, particularly in environments where
multiple individuals — both conspecific and heterospecific — can
detect emitted signals (Virant-Doberlet et al., 2023). To explain how
vibratory territorial behaviour evolved in F- bilineata, it is important
to consider their natural habitat. Adult F. bilineata females lay eggs
in rows on leaves (Bowen et al., 2008). Although eggs laid in
clusters can be a predictor of sociality in Lepidoptera larvae (Costa,
2006; Despland, 2021), warty birch caterpillars live solitarily

throughout their development (Bowen et al., 2008), and therefore
egg clustering may function for some other purpose, such as to
prevent desiccation (Despland, 2021). Upon hatching, neonates,
which experience high mortality owing to a number of biotic and
abiotic factors, are under pressure to disperse immediately and to
establish themselves and begin feeding (see Zalucki et al., 2002). In
animals that start from the same place prior to dispersal, the search
pattern for resources often overlaps between individuals (Krause
and Ruxton, 2002). In neonate F. bilineata, emerging larvae
searching for leaf tips are likely to have frequent encounters with
conspecifics, and thus competition for leaf tips may drive territorial
behaviour. Once established on a leaf tip territory, intermittent
signalling bouts by undisturbed residents may function to broadcast
a message of leaf-tip occupancy to wandering conspecifics. One
of the most direct forms of territorial maintenance is through
repetitious signalling, directed not at a specific individual, but
broadcast into the environment (Wilson, 2000). Thus, signalling
could be a species-specific message announcing, “This leaf tip is
already occupied’. A group of neighbours on a tree branch may
maintain spacing by forming a communication network by
signalling on a regular basis to advertise occupancy, distance and
possibly, identity (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998; McGregor,
1993). An alternative but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that
signalling by territory holders may extend to the broader community
on the tree, including potential predators or other competitors for
leaf space (e.g. Cappuccino, 1993; Fitzpatrick and Wellington,
1983; Rose and Lindquist, 1997). For example, complex vibratory
signals may function as deimatic displays (Low et al., 2021), or by
mimicking something more dangerous, such as the vibratory
territorial or mating signals of a jumping spider (e.g. Elias et al.,
2003, 2008). Interestingly, such spider vibratory displays can also
be multicomponent and described as having ‘buzzes’, ‘thumps’ and
‘scrapes’ (Brandt et al., 2020; Elias et al., 2003).

To better understand why these tiny caterpillars defend leaf tips
using complex vibrations, future research must consider biotic and
abiotic factors in their natural habitat, including vibrations produced
by conspecifics, predators and other competitors for leaf space, as
well as noise from wind and rain (e.g. Guedes et al., 2012; Turchen
et al., 2023). For example, observing how recently hatched neonates
distribute themselves on a host plant would inform us about the role
of vibrations in conspecific spacing. Also, identifying heterospecifics
that occur on the host plant, including predators, parasitoids and
competitors, would provide further insights into other possible
functions of signalling, and whether the caterpillars can discriminate
between different species. Finally, examining plant traits that
influence vibration propagation (e.g. Casas et al., 2007; Magal
et al., 2000; Velilla et al., 2020) could reveal how different regions
of a leaf resonate with these signals and the distances they can
travel. Such information can help to better understand caterpillar
territoriality, spacing behaviours and other selection pressures that
drive their interactions and communication in the natural vibroscape.
