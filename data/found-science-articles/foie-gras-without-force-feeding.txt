ABSTRACT

Foie gras (paté) is an exceptional delicacy with a distinctive sensory profile. However, the animals, primarily ducks and geese, are force-fed a
high-caloric cereals-based diet to obtain the fatty liver. With increasing awareness of ethical conditions and animal welfare, products that
mimic the unique textural characteristics of foie gras paté are entering the market. The present work shows a way to produce a foie gras-like
paté based on the same raw materials as a convenient homemade liver paté by enzymatic treatment of fat with Candida rugosa type VII lipase.
The distribution of mono-, di- and triglycerides is altered, which affects the melting profile measured by dynamic scanning calorimetry
(DSC). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) were used to compare the solid fat content and
the crystalline part of the fat samples, showing an increase in both values compared to the untreated fat. The paté samples were analyzed by
rheological methods and force measurements to determine physical properties such as storage modulus and hardness. The emulsion structure
was evaluated by coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, and fat droplet size and shape were assessed. When the textural
properties of the patés are compared, the treated fat patés behave more like real foie gras patés than their untreated counterparts.

I. INTRODUCTION

Force-fed goose or duck livers, and foie gras (fatty liver, literally
from French) have a high reputation in restaurants offering fine din-
ing. Indeed, their flavor, texture, and mouthfeel are appreciated to be
exceptional and can be hardly imitated by other products, no matter
whether foie gras is served fried, poached, or in more convenient cases,
an transformed to paté' by careful mixing, which preserves the fat dis-
tribution of the fatty liver. This process is followed by heating at a max-
imum of 70°C, which ensures pasteurization, but also permanently
cross-links the protein matrix by forming disulfide bridges between
cysteine.”

Foie gras paté is considered to be a semi-solid emulsion-type
preparation with a spreadable consistency. It is characterized by a soft
and melting mouthfeel, a prolonged release of flavor, and a persistent
oral coating.” From a culinary perspective, foie gras paté is a food
product with a smooth and rich texture, which is highly regarded as a
delicacy in many countries.

In contrast, the production of foie gras is prohibited in numerous
countries since it is produced through the force-feeding of geese for

several weeks before slaughter.’ Therefore, it is imperative to identify
alternative methods for producing analogous products based on liver
and fat that do not involve products from force-feeding by gavage.

It is evident that an effort to emulate the properties of foie gras
paté entails a deliberate augmentation of the collagen content. To
accomplish this objective, collagen-rich tissues, such as skin, undergo
extensive cooking to produce a gel. The gel is subsequently integrated
with liver and fat to form a paté.” The gelatin obtained from this pro-
cess forms a network that, when dissolved in the oral cavity between
25° and 30°C, leaves a melting impression. However, due to enhanced
gel-like elasticity and the slow dissolution by unwinding of the gelatin
tripelhelices,’ the resulting mouthfeel exhibits clear sensory differences
when compared to foie gras paté.'” The composition of other products
involves the incorporation of ingredients from disparate sources,
including but not limited to butter, eggs, powdered milk, coconut fat,
and agarose. The purpose of this amalgamation of ingredients is to
achieve the desired textural characteristics.'' Such preparations show
in many cases unsatisfactory melting behavior during oral processing,
which leads to enhanced friction.'*

Physics of Fluids

From a technological standpoint, patés made with upgraded liver
bases and additives will never match the quality and oral sensations of
foie gras. Typical additives, such as collagen, gelatin, or emulsifiers
with different physical properties, are incapable of enhancing the phys-
ical and textural characteristics of liver-fat-based emulsions to the
extent of achieving the mouthfeel of foie gras patés, as demonstrated
in particular, designed experiments with similar matrices.’

However, a neat way to avoid force-feeding and gavage is to use
the livers of slaughtered animals and their natural, subcutaneous ren-
dered fat and transform them into a product that resembles foie gras
paté without adding any proteins, emulsifiers, or fats from other sour-
ces.’ The primary outcome of this study was the successful production
of pure duck liver patés. However, significant deficiencies in the
mechanical and thermal properties of the patés were also observed,
which resulted in a diminished sensory experience during consump-
tion. The underlying physical reasons are evident. First, the melting
behavior of rendered fat differs from that of foie gras fat. Second, the
large-scale structure of the fat distribution cannot be replicated by sim-
ple emulsion processes when fat and protein concentrations are
adjusted to the proportions found in foie gras.

Indeed, the secret behind its extraordinary properties is mainly
defined by its high fat content and, more specifically, by the micro-
scopic distribution of the fat and protein phases. However, it was
already shown by Via et al,‘ that pure liver-fat emulsions cannot
simultaneously satisfy two basic requirements to resemble the micro-
scopic structure of foie gras, namely emulsion stability and the distri-
bution of fat. The essential contribution to texture and mouthfeel is
determined by large, irregular fat clusters, which form percolating par-
ticle networks in the protein matrix. Such fat networks contribute to
the elastic modulus, as is the case with many food materials,’ *'°
including non-food systems such as reinforced elastomers in materials
science.’ '’ In the case of foie gras paté, it is of particular importance
to understand that the elastic nature of the fat network is based on the
random (fractal) nature of the large clusters. These clusters demon-
strate different responses to deformations as elastic matrices based on
cross-linked proteins or polymer chains.”

The occurrence of large-scale fat cluster networks and their spa-
tial distribution in ducks and geese’s fatty livers is presumably a conse-
quence of gavage and force-feeding.’’ The challenge for reconstructing
“foie gras” from the liver and rendered fat is thus to find a biophysical
mechanism that leads to a build-up of large, percolating fat clusters in
a controlled way. A crude look into the fat of living ducks or geese
offers a simple idea for reconstructing foie gras: treat the rendered fat
to some extent with lipase. The outcome of this procedure is the gener-
ation of free fatty acids, mono- and diglycerols, and a concurrent
reduction in triacylglycerols, without altering the overall composition
of the duck or goose fat. Consequently, the polymorphism of the fat
crystals can be expected to change, and the melting point can be
expected to shift.""’’”’ Indeed, the melting regime of rendered duck
and goose fat with 24 to 34°C appears slightly too low * compared to
the fat from foie gras.

The fat metabolism in ducks and geese suggests, however, treating
the fat enzymatically by lipase. Specifically, lipase catalyzes the hydro-
lysis of triglycerides, resulting in the production of free fatty acids and
mono- and di-glycerides. The activity and reaction time of lipase influ-
ence the specific products of this process.” Consequently, alterations
in the melting and crystallization processes are anticipated. The central

premise of this study is to utilize a lipase treatment that has been
meticulously designed to modify the physical characteristics of the ren-
dered fat, thereby aligning it with the properties of foie gras.

From these considerations, strategies and hypotheses for develop-
ing foie gras from liver and rendered fat, both from non-gavage
animals:

1. Lipase treatment increases the solid fat content. Different poly-
morphisms of the lipase-treated fat provide higher melting
regimes, relevant for the mouthfeel and oral processing.

2. Lipase treatment of the rendered fat enables the formation of
large fat clusters, which percolate to form a particle network
within the matrix as in patés from force-fed ducks or geese.

3. Lipase treatment does not change the overall fatty acid distribu-
tion of the duck fat but alters the crystallization behavior signifi-
cantly and thus the large-scale structure of the emulsion.

This hypothesis will be examined by various experiments and their
results. A detailed analysis of the alteration of the fat components will
provide the basis for interpretation.” The thermal behavior of the differ-
ent fats will be studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

The mechanical properties will be examined through the imple-
mentation of amplitude sweeps, a methodological approach that will
facilitate the acquisition of pertinent information regarding the linear
viscoelastic properties. This encompasses the storage and loss moduli,
in addition to the linear viscoelastic range (LVR) at small amplitudes.
At intermediate and large amplitudes, flow points and decreases in the
moduli can be used as measures for a breakdown of the struc-
tures."*"°°*°” Compression tests examine the samples at alternative
stress-deformation paths and will provide complementary structural
information in the context of the present research.'”"””"

A considerable proportion of the mouthfeel of foie gras during
oral processing can be attributed to the thermal characteristics of the
fat.” Any duck fat consists of liquid and solid parts, depending on the
temperature. Temperature increase in the mouth decreases the solid
fat content in the emulsions. It is therefore inevitable to control the
solid fat content in the lipase-treated samples. This is usually done
using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques.»

Apart from these, further insights can be gleaned from wide-
angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments, which facilitate a more
nuanced perspective on the residual solids at a specific temperature, ©
which supports thermal DSC and NMR experiments.

The utilization of CARS (Coherent Anti-stokes Raman spectros-
copy) microscopy has been demonstrated to facilitate the acquisition
of a more profound comprehension of emulsion structures while cir-
cumventing the utilization of mechanical destruction and staining of
the samples by fluorescent dyes.” “”

B. Sample preparation
1. Lipase treatment

The lipase treatment was adapted from Sharma et al.’ 250g of
fat and the reaction vessel with water (ratio 4:1 to the amount of fat)
were preheated in a water bath (Julabo ME 4, JULABO GmbH,
Seelbach, Germany) to 40°C. Afterward, the pH value of the water
was adjusted to pH 7 with a 1M NaOH solution, and the fat was
added. Lipase was added to the duck fat at a rate of 5 mg/g. The vessel
was placed in a water bath heated to 40°C and stirred with a lab stirrer
(IKA T25 EC C 5000, IKA Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen,
Germany) at 350 rpm for 2 to 4h, respectively. To stop the reaction,
1 L of boiling water was added to the reaction mixture. The fat was sep-
arated from the water with a separation funnel. After cooling in a
fridge at 5 °C, it was reheated to 80°C for a complete water separation.

2. Paté preparation

The precise process for preparing paté emulsions has already
been outlined in a previous paper.'’ The following is a reiteration of
the primary steps in the procedure, which were designed to enhance
the clarity and comprehensibility of the subsequent description.
The creation of the emulsions necessitated the incorporation of duck
liver (490 g/kg), rendered duck fat (392 g/kg), lipase-treated duck fat
(392 g/kg), water (98 g/kg), and sodium chloride (20 g/kg). The liver
was minced in two stages using a Hallde VCB-62 vertical cutter-
blender (AB Hallde Maskiner, Kista, Sweden). The initial mincing stage
operated at a speed of 1500 revolutions per minute for 5s and was fol-
lowed by a second stage at a speed of 3000 revolutions per minute for
10s. Sodium chloride was then incorporated into the minced liver with
a brief stirring. Subsequently, fat and water were introduced, and the
mixture underwent emulsification in two distinct steps. The first step
involved 15s of emulsification at 1500rpm, followed by the second
step, which involved 30s of emulsification at 3000 rpm. To maintain a
consistent temperature throughout the process, liquid nitrogen (50-
100 ml) was added between each emulsification step. Following the
degassing process, the batter was transferred into plastic containers and
subsequently subjected to cooking in a preheated water bath (Julabo
ME 4, JULABO GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) at a temperature of 80°C
for 120 min. Thereafter, the cooked samples were allowed to cool and
then stored at a temperature of 5 °C in a refrigerator.

3. Fat extraction

For fat extraction of the purchased foie gras paté samples, they
were dried for at least 48h in a Christ freeze dryer Alpha 1-2 LD plus
(Martin Christ freeze dryers GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany)
and then placed in a Soxhlet extractor. The extraction was performed
with cyclohexane until it remained clear. The solvent was removed by
a rotary evaporator.

C. Lipid analytics
1. Fatty acid distribution and content of mono-, di-, and
tri-glycerides

The fatty acid distribution was determined by gas chromatogra-
phy with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) using the ISO 12966-2
Method’! and the content of mono-, di-, and triglycerides was

Phys. Fluids 37, 037196 (2025); doi: 10.1063/5.0255813

pubs.aip.org/aip/pof

estimated by ISO 18395 Method’? using high-performance size-exclu-
sion chromatography (HPSEC). All measurements were performed by
the external company SGS Germany GmbH. Each sample was shipped
in two 100ml containers. The commercially bought foie gras patés
were sent in, whereas for others the pure fat was analyzed.

2. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)

The temperature profile of the duck fat samples was acquired
with a Mettler Toledo DSC3+/700/453 (Mettler Toledo, Columbus,
Ohio). 20 uL of heated liquid fat were placed into a 100 wL aluminum
crucible, and an empty crucible was used as a reference. The sample
were measured in five segments with a heating rate of 2 K/min using a
nitrogen flow of 30 ml/min: (1) 25-75°C (2) hold 3 min at 75°C, (3)
75 to —100°C (4) —100 to 75°C (5) 75-25°C. From the melting or
crystallization profile and the peak forms, the fusion enthalpy Hyus is
calculated by the area of the melting peaks.

3. Solid fat content-NMR

For detecting the solid fat content (SFC), a Bruker Avance III con-
sole operating at 500.22 MHz 1H Larmor frequency at a Bruker super-
conducting 11.9T wide bore magnet system using a commercial static
1H/X static solid-state NMR probe was used. A spherical sample shape
was chosen using 4mm HR-MAS rotors as a sample holder. The 1H
nutation frequency was adjusted to 62.5 kHz, corresponding to a 90°
pulse length of 4 1s. The temperature was adjusted using a Bruker BSVT
temperature controller. The fat was transferred to a 4mm HR-MAS rotor
sample holder. The samples were placed in the NMR cooled to —20°C
and kept for 30 min and a spectrum was recorded. Then the temperature
of the sample was increased by 5°C and the process was repeated until a
temperature of 50°C was reached. To obtain the SFC, the spectra for
each temperature were analyzed with the Bruker Top Spin Software. The
full spectrum was integrated and set to 1 as a reference. Then the baseline
was adjusted to the base of the sharp peak. The integration of the peak
based on the full spectrum reference yields the liquid fat content (LFC).
The SFC was calculated by SFC(%) = 1 — LFC « 100%. The supple-
mentary material contains exemplary data illustrating the method by
which the SFC was determined from the NMR spectra S1.

4. Crystalline fat content (CFC)—-XRD measurements

The measurements were performed with a Rigaku SmartLab X-
ray diffractometer; therefore, a thin layer of fat was spread on a glass
slide and placed in the sample holder. The samples were measured at 5
and 37°C with a Cu K-alpha X-ray beam with a wavelength of
1.5406 A scanning from 1° to 35° with 0.3°/min. The scattering slit
was set to 0.5° and the receiving slit to 0.3°. To estimate the crystalline
fat content from the diffraction measurements, the area underneath
the total diffractogram and the area of the amorphous phase were inte-
grated. Thereafter, the crystalline fat content was calculated by this
equation CFC(%) = (1 — Aamorphous/Atotal) * 100%.

D. Physical properties
1. Rheology

As already outlined by Via et al.'' rheology experiments were
conducted using a Gemini 200 rheometer (Bohlin Instruments,

37, 037196-3

P0:1Z:p0 S202 Iudy gz

Physics of Fluids ARTICLE

Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK), equipped with a parallel plate
geometry of 25mm diameter. To minimize sample slippage, 60-grit
sandpaper was affixed to both plates. Circular samples, prepared using
a 25 mm template and sliced to appropriate thickness, were positioned
between the plates. The gap size was adjusted based on the sample
thickness until a normal force increase of 2N was observed, yielding
gap dimensions between 1300 and 1950 um. Measurements com-
menced after a 5 min equilibration period, during which the storage
modulus (G’) and loss modulus (G") were recorded. Oscillatory ampli-
tude sweeps were performed with strains ranging from 0.01% to 200%
at a frequency of 1 Hz and a temperature of 5°C. Each sample under-
went at least three measurements. Temperature sweeps were per-
formed on the 0.1% strain at 1 Hz at a rate of 1 K/min starting at 5°C
until 40 °C was reached. The start and end temperatures were held for
5 min. The linear viscoelastic region (LVR) limit was identified as the
strain at which G’ deviated by 10% from its initial value (Gj), while the
flow point was determined where G’ equalled G’.

2. Texture analysis

The hardness of the paté samples was investigated using a
ZwickRoell Universal Testing Machine AllroundLine Z005
(ZwickRoell GmbH, Ulm, Germany) as described by Via et al."
Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 25mm and a height of 20 mm
were prepared for the tests. Compression testing was conducted over
two cycles’ using a 75mm diameter aluminum disk probe, operating
at a speed of 1 mm/s, until the samples were compressed to 75% of
their original height. Measurements were performed at room tempera-
ture, with the samples maintained at 5°C before testing. Each sample
was tested at least six times. Hardness was defined as the maximum
peak force recorded during compression, while elasticity was estimated
by applying linear regression to the initial slope of the compression
curve, using the first five data points exceeding a 0.01% strain
threshold.

E. Microscopic characterization
1. CARS microscopy

As outlined by Via et al.'' coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering

(CARS) microscopy was conducted using the following setup: a Leica
SP8 CARS microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany), a picoEmerald multi-photon laser (APE, Berlin, Germany)
light source, a 650/210 BrightLine HC broadband filter (AHF Analyze
Technik AG, Tiibingen, Germany) and a Leica 40x HC PL IRAPO
objective (NA= 1.10). With the Stokes beam wavelength fixed at
1064.5nm and the pump beam adjusted to 817 nm, the symmetric
-CH, stretching mode (2845 cm” ') was excited to image the fat drop-
lets. Detection was performed in epi-mode with a non-descanned pho-
tomultiplier tube (PMT) detector at room temperature. Laser power
was optimized for each image to ensure signal intensity remained
approximately 20% below saturation. For imaging, paté samples were
sectioned and placed into 8-well chambers with #1.5 glass bottoms
(ibidi GmbH, Grafelfing, Germany) shortly before acquisition. Images
with dimensions of 1928 x 1928 pixels and a pixel size of 0.15 um
were captured at a depth of 5 zm within the sample. Each sample type
was measured in triplicate.

2. Image analysis

Image processing was performed using Fiji software.'*"' Binary
images were generated by applying the Huang algorithm for automatic
thresholding.’” Particles below the resolution limit were excluded as
noise, and clusters with incomplete boundaries within the image frame
were also disregarded. The analysis of fat particles included several
parameters: particle area, aspect ratio, and circularity. The aspect ratio
(AR) represents the ratio of the longest to shortest axes of an ellipse fit-
ted to the particle area, with AR=1 indicating a perfect circle and
higher values reflecting increasing deviation from circularity.
Circularity, which measures the relationship between particle area and
perimeter, captures edge smoothness. Circularity values range from 0
to 1, with 1 corresponding to a perfectly smooth circle and lower val-
ues indicating greater surface roughness.

F. Statistical analysis

To evaluate the statistical significance of all data values, they were
tested with DATAtab (DATAtab: Online Statistics Calculator.
DATAtab e.U. Graz, Austria. URL https://datatab.de). Analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) was used to test the series, whereas each sample was
evaluated against other samples, using Bonferroni post-hoc tests based
on ANOVA. With f-tests, value pairs of an unheated vs heated sample,
significance was tested. All tests were performed with a significance
level of 5% (% = 0.05).

G. Abbreviations

In the following, the abbreviations for the different samples will
be used.

Fats: LTFO untreated rendered duck fat, FGF: fat extracted from
force-fed foie gras paté, LTF2: lipase treatment obtained from LTFO
after 2h; LTF4: lipase-treated fat obtained from LTFO after 4h.

Patés: FGP, foie gras paté. LTPO paté is composed of liver and
untreated fat, LTFO, LTP2,4 patés composed of liver and LTF2 and
FTF4, respectively.

Ill. RESULTS
A. Comparison of different fats

Lipase catalyzes the cleavage of fatty acids from the glycerol back-
bone of triglycerides and is highly time-dependent.”® Increasing the
lipase treatment time to 4h results (LTF4) in a fat composition that is
almost completely broken down and consists mainly of free fatty acids.
Triglycerides remained, and diglycerides were also found for the 2h
shorter treatment (LTF2). The rate of cleavage depends on the number
and length of the fatty acids bound to the glycerol." In comparison,
the untreated native duck fat, LTFO, consists mainly of triglycerides.

The fatty acid profile of the native and treated samples is nearly
identical, as LTFO serves as the substrate for the lipase treatment. This
finding suggests that there has been no loss of fatty acids during the
treatment process and that the samples contain a substantial amount
of free fatty acids.”

1. Fatty acid distribution and mono-, di-, and tri-
glyceride content

To understand the thermal, mechanical, and structural behavior,
it is important to consider the fat and lipid composition. The fatty acid

37, 037196-4

P0:1Z:p0 S202 Iudy gz

Physics of Fluids

distributions of the native duck fat and lipase-treated fat (LTF) samples
differ only slightly, as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the profile of the
FGF sample is different for some specific fatty acids. Palmitoleic acid
was about half as abundant in the foie gras fat (FGF) samples
(1.89 + 0.02%). Conversely, the content of stearic acid in the foie gras
fat, FGF, samples is twice as high (16.25 + 1.57%). The content of oleic
acid (50.89 + 3.22%) is about 8% higher than in the other samples.
The content of linolenic acid in the FG samples was 10 times lower
than in the native and LT fat samples, with about 15% to 1.3%.

Overall, the content of saturated fatty acids was higher in the FGF
sample (42.43 + 3.23% compared to about 34.00%), as is the content
of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (55.0 to 48.5%). In contrast, the con-
tent of polyunsaturated fatty acids is an order of magnitude higher in
the native and LT-treated samples (about 17.0% compared to 1.7%).
The detailed values are given in Table I.

The content of mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides differs for all sam-
ples, as shown in Fig. 2. The monoglyceride content was close to zero
for all samples, except for sample LTF2, which reached a monoglycer-
ide content of 1.05 + 0.05%. The same behavior is observed for the
diglycerides, where all the samples, except sample LTF2 with
7.10 + 1.30%, have a content of around 1% diglycerides. The greatest
differences were found in the triglycerides and free fatty acids. The
untreated fat sample (LTFO) had a triglyceride content of
97.90 + 0.00% and a free fatty acid content of 0.6 + 0.0%. The FGF
sample had a triglyceride and free fatty acid content of 90.05 + 4.55%
and 8.8 + 4.70%, respectively. For the lipase-treated samples, the

2

ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/pof

triglyceride content was quite low with 13.85 + 3.45% and
2.15 + 0.05%, and they had the highest free fatty acid content with
78.00 + 4.80% (LTE2) and 96.6 + 0.10% (LTF4), as shown in Table II.

2. DSC measurements

The DSC experiments (see Fig. 3) indicates a notable distinction
in the melting and crystallization behavior between the native (ren-
dered) duck fat (LTFO) and the foie gras fat (FGF). In the context of
this investigation, melting is imperative for the oral process in the
mouth; consequently, the melting process is the primary focus of the
subsequent discussion. However, interested readers can find the com-
plete analysis of the DSC results in the supplementary material.

Initially, it is evident that both FGF and the rendered fat LTPO
exhibit no significant melting peaks within the temperature range
from —60 to —20°C. In contrast, both lipase-treated fats, LTF2,4,
demonstrate clear melting peaks nos. 1, 2, and nos. 3, 4. Two lower
melting peaks appear at around —37 and —19°C [see Fig. 3(b)]. For
the melting in the mouth, these melting processes are of little impor-
tance, but they indicate the cleavage process. The peaks for both LTF2
and LTF4 can be attributed to the melting points of short-chain fatty
acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids. The melting ranges of the unsatu-
rated linolenic acid (C 18:3) and arachidonic acid (C 20:4) were deter-
mined to be —21.0 to —10.4°C and —43.4 to —38.4°C.”" These fatty
acids are part of the native duck fat and are listed in Fig. 3. Table I
shows that these fatty acids have been cleaved by the lipase from

rendered duck fat since the corresponding, much broader crystalliza-
tion peak shows at about 10°C higher temperatures. However, these
fractions do not play a significant role in the mouthfeel but serve
merely as a useful check, as the rendered fat shows a tiny peak at a sim-
ilar temperature as peak no. 3 and 4.

FGF shows a very broad and pronounced peak no. 5; foie gras
fat first underwent a broad and pronounced melting regime, com-
mencing at —20.5°C and concluding at 14.6 °C, with a sharper peak
at 4.4°C and a small shoulder at about 7°C. Immediately it is fol-
lowed by a second melting regime between 14.7 and 44.2°C, with
two peaks at 19.4°C (peak no. 6) and 38.5°C (peak no. 7), which
can be considered as most important for the typical foie gras mouth-
feel because this melting regime is felt in the mouth by texture (and
friction) changes.

In contrast, native, rendered duck fat exhibits melting already at
temperatures between —23.2 and —2.6°C with a peak at —10.8°C,
peak no. 8 in Fig. 3(b), a distinct melting between —2.3 and 7.5°C
(peak no. 9 at 1.3°C), followed by another broad melting regime
between 8.9 and 40.2°C with peaks at 14.9 and 35.9°C (peak nos. 10
and 11). These peaks appear at lower temperatures than those of the
FGF. Both fats exhibit a different mouthfeel during melting in the oral

cavity at about 37°C. Thus, the comparison of the melting profile
shows that pure rendered duck fat will not be able to imitate the melt-
ing behavior of foie gras fat, especially in the temperature range
between 0 and 37°C, relevant for oral processing, where their melting
profiles are different. Rendered (native) duck fat melts at lower tem-
peratures, and thus the long-lasting melting effect known from foie
gras is missing.

However, lipase treatment shows for both exposure times, 2 and
4h, an equalization of the melting curves compared to rendered duck
and foie gras fat. The multiple melting peaks and regimes between
—23.2 and 8.9°C are blurred and joined in a more pronounced
broader peak (LTF2: no. 12, LTF4: no. 13) ranging between —16.1 and
about 6.7 °C.

The pronounced melting peaks 12 and 13 in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)
within the range of —5 to 15°C after lipase treatments are most likely
generated from oleic acid 18:1 dominated crystals, which take up a
large fraction of the duck fat, as can be seen in Table I. The corre-
sponding crystallization peaks can be located at about —5 and —10°C.
Thus, it suggests again that a sufficient number of the C 18:1 fatty acids
are cleaved from the triglycerides in the rendered fat to form reversible
melting in crystallization.

FIG. 2. Distribution of monoglycerides (MG: light blue bars), diglycerides (DG: dark
red bars), and triglycerides (TG: green bars), and free fatty acids (FFA: orange
bars) of the different fat samples used in the emulsions. Above the main graph is a
zoom to show the detailed distribution of the mono- and di-glycerides.

In foie gras fat samples, these low-temperature peaks do appear
in the melting, despite their presence, because these fatty acids are
mostly bound in triglycerides and cannot form larger crystals among
themselves. However, signatures of triglycerides containing polyunsat-
urated fatty acids can be detected in the crystallization profile
[Fig. 3(c)] in the temperature range of —30 to —18°C.

It is evident that the melting peaks are considerably broader and
thus encompass a more extensive temperature range than the crystalli-
zation peaks. Most important for the texture and the mouthfeel are the
pronounced melting regimes between —8.9 and 6.6°C and the broad
regime between 6.7 and 42.4 °C, which are induced by the lipase treat-
ment. These melting peaks (LTF2: peak nos. 12 and 14, LTF4: peak
nos. 13 and 15) show a broad distribution starting with a shoulder to
lower temperatures, leading to a peak temperature of 4.1 and 37.6 °C.

A comparison between the foie gras fat (FGF) shows immediately
that this lipase treatment-induced melting region is similar to the melt-
ing regime of the foie gras. In other words, the broad melting regime
of the LTFO (native duck fat) between peaks nos. 10 and 11 becomes
shifted to higher temperature ranges and thus closer to those of FGF.
This is quite intriguing since lipase action under a given time and

pubs.aip.org/aip/pof

activity increases the amount of free fatty acids in such a way that the
higher effect of the higher amount of C 18:0 lipids in foie gras is
compensated.
Table | shows the molecular origin of the differences in the melting
properties. Foie gras fat contains more saturated fatty acids than rendered
duck fat, especially stearic acid, C 18:0, which is about double in concen-
tration. Furthermore, oleic acid, C 18:1, is found to be significantly more
prevalent at 51% than in rendered fat at 43%. On the other hand, more
linoleic acid, C 18:2, appears in rendered fat than in foie gras fat. Only
the concentration of palmitic acid, C 16:0, is about the same in both fats.
The peaks of the lipase-treated samples indicate a higher heat flux
than the native and FGF samples. Integration of the peaks shows that
the enthalpy of melting is, with around — 146 J/g, two times higher in
total in the lipase-treated samples (see Table III) compared to the
native duck fat and foie gras fat. The three peaks of the native duck fat
contribute with —22.0J/g (peak no. 8), —21.7J/g (peak no. 9), and
—28.2 J/g for the regime of peak nos. 10 and 11 to a total heat of fusion
of —71.9 J/g. For the foie gras fat, the two broad regimes have a total
melting enthalpy of —40.7 J/g (peak no. 5) and —24.7 J/g (sum of peak
no. 10 and 11). Both lipase-treated samples differed only marginally in
the absorbtion of heat during melting. Whereas the more pronounced
peaks in both samples (nos. 12,13 and 14,15 in panel B of Fig. 3)
absorbs around —67 and —61 J/g of heat, leading to a total heat of
fusion of around — 146 J/g (see Table II1).

These differences are also manifested in the crystallization behav-
ior. The crystallization of different fractions of the foie gras fat (FGF)
starts at about 3.8 °C to 13.8 °C earlier than those of the rendered duck
fat. Three different crystallization peaks are visible for both samples,
and the first starting at 23.9°C and transitioning into the next peak at
9.0°C for the foie gras fat and 4.8°C for the native duck fat, respec-
tively. The peak temperature is at 6.6 °C for the foie gras fat and 2.1°C
for the native duck fat, and both show a shoulder to lower tempera-
tures. For the foie gras fat, the last peak ranges from —16.4 to
—36.8°C and for the native duck fat, from —29.7 to —44.7°C. On the
reverse, the corresponding crystallization process was started at 32°C
for both lipase-treated samples, with sharp peaks at 30.4°C. Both have
a shoulder to lower temperatures, ending at —2.3°C and with a transi-
tion into the next peaks at —2.4°C. The peak maximum of the peaks
at —4.5°C also has a broader shoulder at lower temperatures, which
transitions into two peaks at —24.9 and —41.5°C, as shown in
Fig. 3(Panel C) and supplementary material Table $1).

As for the melting, the energy released by crystallization was
around 140 J/g for the lipase-treated samples, which is twice as high as
for the native duck fat and foie gras fat samples with 70.0 and 74.1 J/g,
respectively (see supplementary material Table $1). A further detailed
description of the melting and crystallization behavior is shown in the
supplementary material.

FIG. 3. Panel A displays the mean DSC curves for each fat sample for an overview. Panel B provides a magnified view of the melting process from the DSC measurements.
Panel C illustrates the crystallization profile during the heating of the fat samples. The untreated duck fat (LTFO) is shown in blue; the fat extracted from the foie gras paté is
marked in red (FGF). The two different lipase-treated fat samples are plotted in purple (2h: LTF2) and yellow (4h: LTF4).

Consequently, the differently shaped peaks resulting from lipase point to more crystals with fewer defects’ after lipase treatment,
treatment (nos. 12 and 13) require a significantly higher latent heat for which is explained by the increase in concentrations of fatty acids,
melting in this temperature regime as FGF in the relevant mouthfeel which form stable crystals, as will be confirmed by the WAXS and

FIG. 4. The temperature-dependent solid fat content. The black vertical dashed line
black indicates T = 5°C, the dashed red line the mouth temperature T = 37°C.
The native duck fat (LTFO) is marked blue, the foie gras fat (FGF) red and purple
and yellow for 2 and 4h lipase treated fat (LTF2, LTF4).

3. Solid and crystalline fat content

The solid fat content (SFC) as a function of temperature is shown
in Fig. 4. As expected, at low temperatures, —20 °C, the solid fat content
is the highest for each sample, ranging from 68.1 + 3.0% (LTFO) to
89.5 + 1.5% for the LTF4 sample. With increasing temperature, the
solid fat content decreases due to selective and partial melting, as already
seen by the distinct broader melting regimes in Fig. 3. At 5°C, where all
mechanical experiments were carried out, the SFC was located between
26.4 + 4.2 (LTF2) and 57.9 + 3.1% (FGF). The native fat has a slightly
higher SFC of around 29.0 + 4.1% than the LTF2 sample, as shown in
Fig. 4. The LTF4 sample is in between with 41.6 + 2.4%.

The curve progression of the various samples with increasing tem-
perature is of particular interest here. The SFC of native, rendered duck
fat (LTFO) starts at 20°C from the lowest value and decreases smoothly
and gradually and is almost molten and liquid at the mouth temperature
T = 37°C. FGF shows a smooth and gradual decrease as well but shows
a higher SFC as native duck fat for all temperatures. At about 40°C
both approach each other. The important point for the present consider-
ations is that FGF exhibits at 37 °C still a SFC of about 4.4%.

A visual analysis of the curves reveals significant differences in their
shape, with lipase-treated fat samples exhibiting a distinctive pattern.
First, the 4h lipase treatment shows much higher values compared to
the 2h treatment. In the temperature range between —20 and 10°C,
both LTF2 and LTF4 exhibit a steeper and more monotonous decline in
comparison to the native fat and FG. However, both LTF2 and LTF4
display a kink, indicating a slower decrease toward lower SFC values.
The melting profiles of both LTF2 and LTF4 indicate an initial melting
at lower temperatures, as evidenced by the peaks labeled nos. 12 and 13
in Fig. 3, and a slower melting starting between 20 and 40°C, as seen in
the DSC at the broad peaks nos. 14 and 15, for both treatments.

In addition, both lipase treatments show a finite value for the SFC
at 37°C as FGF. The SFC for the 2h treatment is 1.8% slightly below
the LTFO with 2.2% and the FGF with 4.4%, whereas the 4h treatment
is 5.8% slightly higher (see Table IV). Nevertheless, the values for

LTF2,4 compare very well to each other and prove that an appropriate
lipase treatment changes the melting properties of rendered fats in the
targeted direction. For a consistent picture, an overview of the analyzed
NMR spectra for each sample is shown in the supplementary material.
Supplementary material Figs. $2 to $5 provide the measurements at
T=—20°C, T=5°Cand T = 35°C of each sample.

The crystalline fat content (CFC) was estimated from wide-angle
XRD measurements (WAXS) at 5°C as shown in Fig. 5. The native fat
sample (LTFO) had the lowest crystalline fat content with 11.0 + 0.6%,
followed by the foie gras fat sample with 18.3 + 3.3%. For the lipase-
treated samples, a crystalline fat content of 32.6 + 5.1% (LTF2) and
39.1 + 3.3% (LTF4) was measured (see Fig. 6(a) and Table IV). In
Fig. 6(b), the fat samples were measured with wide-angle X-rays at 37 °C
and for native fat, barely any crystalline fat content is present. Whereas,
for the 2h lipase-treated fat, still some peaks are visible in the XRD mea-
surements. The measurements of foie gras fat, FGF, as well as LTF4,
exhibit a pronounced number of X-ray reflexes, more than LTF2. By esti-
mating the peak area of the XRD graphs, the crystalline part of the solid
fat fraction was determined. This can be seen in Table IV, by the system-
atic differences in the values for the SFC and CFC at 5°C for the differ-
ent samples. These discrepancies can be attributed to the fundamental
disparities in the measurement techniques employed. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) probes are capable of discerning local (atomistic)
scales, while wide-angle X-ray scattering probes are more apt at detecting
scales at the lattice distances. However, nuclear magnetic resonance
detects immobile, solid parts in amorphous and crystalline parts, whereas
wide-angle X-ray scattering only identifies hard crystalline solid parts.

FIG. 5. Wide-angle X-ray profiles measurement of the different samples at 5°C. The insert shows a zoom of the y-axis to enhance the visibility of the main peak regions. The
Native duck fat is shown as a blue line, the foie gras fat (FGF) is shown in red. The lipase treated samples are shown as a purple (2h: LTF2) and yellow (4h: LTF4) line.

Therefore, the values for SFC measured by NMR are higher than those
for CFC provided by the WAXS experiments. Consequently, the NVR
also includes the amorphous and immobile defect-rich fraction of the
solid fat phase. Similar trends of much larger SFC values compared to
CFC have also been found by Arita-Merino et al."

This result indicates that the crystal fraction increases with lipase
exposure time between 2 and 4h, which is due to the still increasing con-
centrations of free fatty acids by ongoing cleavage, especially from the
dominant fraction of C 16:0, C 18:0, and C 18:1 fatty acids. As shown in
Fig. 6(b), the crystal fraction increases still between 2 and 4h of lipase
treatment, up to double the value compared to rendered duck fat.
Consequently, larger and more stable crystals may appear. This assump-
tion will be confirmed by the results of the CARS experiments below.

Another point that corroborates this claim is evidenced by
WAXS experiments conducted on samples at 37°C, which is equiva-
lent to the temperature of the oral cavity. These results are shown in
Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 6(b) parts of the fat melt between 5 and 37°C.
As suggested by the DSC experiments in Fig. 3, LT4h shows the high-
est and most stable crystal fraction.

At T = 37°C native, rendered fat shows only one small peak at
about 20 ~ 5°, which is most likely generated by the remaining crystals of
triglycerides containing longer fatty acid chains. Most of the fat is molten,
and only 2.7 + 0.6% remains crystalline. LTF2 already shows more peaks
and a CFC of 12.9 + 2.0%, which becomes even more pronounced after
4h of treatment, and a higher CFC of 18.3 + 3.3% is measured. Lipase
treatment generates peaks that resemble those of FGF, which shows a crys-
talline fat content of 5.6 + 1.9%. These peaks are temperature-persistent at
temperatures experienced during oral processing.

A comparison of the change in the CFC shows this immediately.
The decrease in the CFC for the different fats at 5 and 37 °C is quite dif-
ferent. The native duck fat drops by a factor of about 4.4, and the FG fat

by a much lower factor of 3.3. LTF2 drops decrease only by a factor of
2.6, whereas LTF4 drops by the lowest factor of 1.7.

B. Mechanical methods

Mechanical properties were evaluated by employing rheological
and texture analysis methods. The deformation-dependent viscoelastic
properties were measured by amplitude sweeps and gave the storage
modulus (G}), loss modulus (G"), flow point, and linear viscoelastic
range (LVR). Their results are shown in Fig. 7 with an example plot.
The mean values are given in Table V. All samples were measured in
the heated and unheated state (except store-bought FG samples) at 5°C.

All heated patés (cooled to 5 °C) were examined by texture analy-
sis to determine maximum force (hardness), strain of maximum force,
and initial slope. Example plots of the heated samples are shown in
Fig. 7, and the values are listed in Table V.

1. Rheology

The initial modulus Gp of the heated samples was about twice as
high for the lipase-treated patés (LTP2: 216 700 + 12300 Pa; LTP4:
247 400 + 2400 Pa) and Foie gras paté (FGP: 256 800 + 29 400 Pa) as
for the LTPO with 118000 + 16 200 Pa. A similar trend was observed
for the LVR and the flow point. Starting from 0.46 + 0.09% and
39.6 + 3.7% for the LTPO sample, both values decrease with lipase-
treated fat (LTP2: 0.25 + 0.06% and 33.3 + 7.8%; LTP4: 0.14 + 0.02%
and 24.4 + 4.7%) and correspond to the FGP values of 0.12 + 0.01%
and 23.2 + 1.1% strain. As well as, the LVR and the flow point are
shifted to lower strains, which indicates the same early structural
breakup in the emulsion structure.’

At first sight, the results for the amplitude sweeps expressed by
the storage modulus G’ appear very similar for FGP, LTP2, and LTP4.

fat (LTFO) is marked blue, the foie gras fat (FGF) red and purple for 2h lipase
treated fat (LTF2) and yellow for 4 h treatment time (LTF4).

Nonetheless, significant distinctions can be identified. First, the
increase in the linear modulus G’ is for the LTP4 slightly higher than
for LTP2, but both are close to the FGP sample, its modulus appears
even slightly higher, but not significant. The shorter LVR of the LTP2
and 4 indicates a first irreversible breakdown of the emulsion structure
comparable to the FGP samples. Whereas the flow point, the point
where G” exceeds G’, for the lipase-treated samples is also shifted to
lower amplitudes, and the LTP4 samples match the FGP samples. This
indicates that the lipase-treated samples are, as well as the FGP sam-
ples, more rigid and less elastic, and that lower shear strains cause irre-
versible damage to the emulsion structure.'* If even more shear is
applied to the samples, the LTPO and FGP samples have a steeper
decrease in moduli than the LTP2 and LTP4 samples.

However, since the fat embedding matrix is physically the same
as all samples, the differences are caused by the lipase-induced differ-
ent fat structures, as already seen in the DSC and X-ray experiments.
On the other hand, it is known that small structural changes are not
always clearly exhibited by rheology,’ therefore, alternative

methods, such as compression tests, are needed. These results are
shown in the following.

2. Texture analysis

As seen in Fig. 7(b), the LTP2 and LTP4 samples are significantly
stiffer than the paté with untreated duck fat LTP0. The force-strain
curves of the lipase-treated patés also demonstrate higher values as the
FGP, yet the shapes of the LTP2 and LTP4 curves are more closely
aligned with the FGP as LTPO.

The differences in the mechanical properties of the samples are
clearly more prominent in Fig. 7(b) than in Fig. 7(a). The LTPO samples
reached a hardness of 13.2 + 3.6 N and a strain at maximum force of
32.4 + 3.7%. The initial slope was 0.4+ 0.2. The FGP samples were
slightly harder with a maximum force of 17.0 + 4.0 N, but the maximum
force was already reached at 16.6 + 0.6% strain and an initial slope of
0.6 + 0.3. Both lipases-treated patés exceeded the other samples in hard-
ness with 26.4 + 2.2 N (LTP2) and 19.57 + 1.70 N (LTP4). The elonga-
tion of the maximum forces is closer to the FG paté with 22.3 + 1.7%
(LTP2) and 20.5 + 1.9% (LTP4) than to the control paté LTPO.

The results of these compression experiments demonstrate the
significant impact of the physical properties of fats following different
lipase treatments. LTPO demonstrates a continuous increase in force
with increasing deformation, exhibiting a “plastic” softening between
30% and 55% strain. The maxima of LTP2 are even more pronounced
compared to LTP4, but both exceed the maximum of FGP. Also, the
deformation at the force maximum is shifted to shorter strains. LTP2
shows the highest value for force (hardness), whereas LTP4 shows
lower values. The FGP and LTP4 samples tend to break shortly after
the compression force is applied, which results in lower force and
strain values compared to LTPO. The supplementary material includes
photographs of the samples taken during and after the compression
tests (see supplementary material Figs. $7, $8, and $9).

These mechanical results already suggest changes in the mouth-
feel for the different patés. The LVR indicates the range of elastic
recovery at given deformations. Although these values at very small
strains appear irrelevant for oral processing, they indicate the stability
of the large-scale structure before becoming successively destroyed at
larger strains, as shown by the stronger decrease in the moduli even
above the flow point. Thus, LTPO has the most linear elastic response,
and FGP the lowest. These properties correspond to the first contact
between the tongue and palate at very small stains. At higher strains,
respectively, larger (horizontal) movements of the tongue, the moduli
decrease, and the patés become more viscous, when G’ < G”. Again,
the flow point of LTP4 is closest to FGP, which means that the break-
down of the underlying structure can be similar in the mouth.

Concerning the linear elastic response, LTP4 comes closest to
FGP. Hardness, e.g., when the tongue is pressed toward the palate and
expressed with the maximum force in Fig. 7(b), is larger for LTP2 and
LTP4 than for FGP. The reason for this can be drawn back to the dif-
ferent crystal structures of FGP and LTP0,2,4. These mechanical and
thermal properties provide the first indications for different oral sensa-
tions. As a corollary, the disparities in fat arrangement among the sam-
ples manifest as variations in fracture properties, as evidenced by the
typical photographs provided in the supplementary material.

However, these results have to be discussed in the context of the
large-scale fat structure, which seems to be contractive with the results
from the fat analysis, the SFC, and the WAXS results. Therefore,

additional information from CARS microscopy and the corresponding
image analysis will shed more light on the behavior of the differently
prepared patés.

C. CARS and image analysis

Preliminary observations suggest that the LTP2 sample exhibits a
more compact particle network compared to the FG and LTP4 samples.
Additionally, the patés LTP2 and LTP4 show significant differences in
the fat structure and distribution, as shown in Fig. 8. The LTP2 samples
show percolating fat clusters in many regions, in contrast to LTP4 sam-
ples. In the LTP2 samples, only a few bright crystals appear (see left pic-
ture). It seems that in LTP2 only limited regions show "pefect" crystals.
Whereas, for the LTP4, these highly crystalline structures were found
distributed in large parts of the sample (Fig. 8 LTP4). However, some fat
crystals form larger clusters as well as fat particles, as can be seen in the
middle picture of LTP4 in Fig. 8.

LTP4 samples still contain larger clusters but also connected
regions (left and right) and appear less dense. Additionally, the LTP4
samples show very bright needle-like crystals, which seem to join a
larger amount of free fatty acids. This explains, most likely, the non-

percolating clusters, since the amorphous part of the fats decreases
with the increasing CFC by higher lipase exposure time, as suggested
by Fig. 5. A more detailed analysis shows the structural properties
better.

The images, Figs. 8 and 12, were analyzed to obtain the area-
weighted particle size distribution, shown in Fig. 9, and different shape
descriptors such as aspect ratio and circularity (see Fig. 10 and Table
VI). These results reveal differences between the FGP sample and the
lipase-treated samples. The FGP sample shows larger fat particle clus-
ters (see Vig. 12). The lipase-treated samples also had an emulsion
structure made of interconnected fat particles.

The FGP shows a well-defined network of connected fat particles
that are greater than 10000 jxm?, which contributes to around 24% of
the total fat area of the samples. Between these percolating clusters are
well-separated medium-sized particles of 100 to 10000 ym?, which
covers most of the fat area. Compared to this, the LTP2 shows a perco-
lating fat network as well. This covers nearly 50% of the total fat and is
the most pronounced in all the samples since it exceeds the area per-
centage for the largest particles in the other samples.

The area covered by particles greater than 10000 jum? in the
LTP4 sample is 25% close to the FGP sample, and in the images,

samples is relatively close, with the LTP2 samples having the lowest
coverage (5.3%) and the LTP4 the highest (20.5%). The same can be
seen for the size group 100-1000 jm’, which covers an area of 15.9%
in the LTP2 samples, 24.7% in the LT4 sample, 17.7% in the FGP sam-
ple, and 33.9% in the LTPO sample. For the LTPO and FGP samples,
particles between 1000 and 10000 zm” have the largest area, covering

ARTICLE pubs.aip.org/aip/pof

45.9% and 37.4% of the total area, respectively. Particles larger than
10000 ym? cover 49.2% of the fat area in the LTP2, whereas in the
LTPO only 4.0% is covered by these large particles.

In the FGP and LTP4 samples, about a quarter of the area is cov-
ered with particles larger than 10 000 xm’. The LTP2 and FG samples
overall show similarities in the area-weighted size distribution, whereas
LTPO shows a higher number of smaller particles and fewer particles
with a size over 10 000 zm. The LTP4 sample distribution is quite dif-
ferent from the other samples because nearly a third of the area is cov-
ered with particles up to 100 pm?. However, with 26.5%, it shows as
many particles greater than 10000 zm? as the FGP sample. The ele-
vated crystalline fat content, in conjunction with the cleavage within
the higher portion of C 18:0, C 18:1, and C 16:0 fatty acids, facilitates
the crystallization of more monocline crystals with minimal defects
across numerous spatial positions, thereby reducing the intermediate
cluster size to a range of 1000 to 10 000. zm. Consequently, the amor-
phous and partially molten fat clusters become less prominent as the
exposure time to lipase is increased.

The results shown in Fig. 9 indicates a systematic decrease in the
area covered by the particle group characterized by a particle size of
1000-10 000 zm? as the treatment time increases. LTP4 attains a com-
parable regime at approximately 75% of that of FGP, yet maintains a
considerably more restricted profile. This lends further credence to the
hypothesis that the occurrence of substantial crystal formation
impedes the proliferation of large clusters and renders percolating
structures less probable. Conversely, LPT2 appears to align more
closely with the lower coverage regime. Nonetheless, the present analy-
sis delineates methodologies for the implementation of lipase treat-
ment, with consideration for activity and exposure time parameters,
thereby ensuring the modulation of mouthfeel and the preservation of
fat structure in a prescribed manner. A more detailed analysis of the
shape descriptors, aspect ratio (AR), and circularity will underline
these results.

2. Shape descriptors

The aspect ratio (Table V1) of the samples was 1.7 + 0.6 for the
FGP, 1.9 + 0.7 for the LTP2, and 2.1 + 0.9 for LTP4, higher than the
LTPO, which had an AR of 1.4 0.5 (Fig. 10 A). Circularity showed
lower values for the LTP2 and FGP (LTP2: 0.6 + 0.2; FGP: 0.7 + 0.2)
compared to the control with 0.8 + 0.2. However, it drastically drops
for the LTP4 sample to 0.14 + 0.08 (Fig. 10 B). The increase in aspect
ratio is due to the more irregularly shaped particles in the LTP2 and
LTP4 samples. For the LTP2 sample, mainly the bigger irregular par-
ticles, which build fat clusters, are responsible for the increase in the
AR. For the LTP4 sample, the fat crystals also elongate the smaller par-
ticles because of the needle-like structure. This effect is even more pro-
nounced for the circularity, which is a measure of the particle

roughness. In parallel with the AR, the LTP2 and FGP are less smooth
due to larger fat clusters. Whereas the circularity of the LTP4 sample
drops by a factor of 4 compared to the LTP2 sample. Here, too, the
smaller fat crystals cause less rounded and rougher fat particles.

The results are most striking. As mentioned earlier,’ the forma-
tion of large, percolating, random fat clusters is imperative for a typical
“foie gras mouthfeel.” As shown in Fig. 9, this is the case for FGP and
LTP2. Pure emulsions, like the LTPO, cannot be the case for simple
physical reasons. However, the samples for LTP4 still show regions
with large percolating clusters, but also regions with non-connected
clusters. Conversely, the CARS microscopy images manifest a conspic-
uously elevated concentration of stable crystals, manifest in the bright
areas, which have a distinct impact on the size distribution and shape
descriptors of the LTP4 sample.

IV. CONVERGING DISCUSSION

In essence, it has been shown how to produce foie gras of ducks
or geese without any force-feeding and without using any additional
components, such as stabilizers and emulsifiers. The only ingredients
are the animal’s own rendered fat and their liver, which are side prod-
ucts of every duck or goose farm. Simple emulsions of these two com-
ponents do not lead to satisfactory properties in texture and
mouthfeel.'* In this publication, the essential contribution of the exis-
tence of a fat-percolating fat network was already demonstrated.

The lipase treatment of rendered fat provides, by cleaving fatty
acids from tri-glycerides a basis for forming connected fat networks
with significant contributions to the mechanical properties, as demon-
strated in Table | and Fig. 8.

To comprehensively interpret the underlying physics of these
observations, it is imperative to retrace the steps involved in the prepa-
ration of the samples, except for FGP because this is based on a natural
product and commercially sold. It has been shown, so far, that the fat

pubs.aip.org/aip/pof

structure plays the most important role in the mechanical properties
and thus the mouthfeel.

This can be easily demonstrated when the mechanical properties
of the uncross-linked, i.e., unheated patés are compared to those after
heating, when the liver matrix becomes cross-linked. In the uncross-
linked case, only the viscoelastic contribution and the mechanical
impact of the fat are shown, especially when all matrices are similar in
composition and preparation. The corresponding experiments are
shown in Fig. 11.

The presence of differently structured fat networks alone changes
already the mechanical behavior, as can be seen in the rheology of the
non-heated, ie. non-cross-linked matrices (Fig. 11). The Gj of the
unheated patés increases steeply with longer treatment times and
reaches 86100 + 15400 Pa, almost five times that of the paté with
untreated fat (LTPO, see Table \V). Indeed, the moduli of the uncooked
samples demonstrate a closer resemblance to those of FGP, nearly
matching the cooked LTPO sample. However, these results offer
insights that are more profound and less straightforward. The ampli-
tude of storage and loss moduli increases in proportion to the duration
of lipase exposure. LTP4 samples show the highest storage modulus,
followed by LTP2 and pate prepared by untreated rendered duck fat,
LTPO.

At first sight, this seems to contradict what has been discussed
before. However, the hard, stable, and larger crystals after 4h lipase
treatment contribute as hard filler particles in the soft matrix strongly
to the modulus of the uncross-linked fat matrix.'* The 2h treatment
does not show sufficiently high concentrations of such crystals; solid
fat stays amorphous but forms percolating clusters. Their different
behavior indicates itself at different strains, especially in the stronger
decrease in G’ between 12% and 110%, which can be addressed by the
successive breaking of the large clusters. The LTP4 paté, however,
shows a smooth decrease; the solid filler particles move within the

deforming matrix. Indeed, at strains larger than 10%, the unheated
LTP4 already follows the curve of the cooked and FGP, which demon-
strates the high impact of the fat network.

Of course, other properties such as LVR, flow points, etc., are
very different because of the different fat structures and the lack of
cross-links. Heating-induced cross-linking increases the modulus by
= 100kPa for the LTPO. The further increase for LT 2h and LT 4h
samples must consequently be caused by the different large scale fat
structures. The importance of these structures in the final patés after
heating has already been discussed earlier by Via et al.'* To visualize
the typical different structures in FGP and the lipase-treated samples,
the CARS images were compared directly in Fig. 12. The images
shown in Fig. 12 are directly extracted from typical CARS microscopy
pictures shown already in Fig. 8 by removing the matrix background
to discuss the influence of the fat structure on the mechanical proper-
ties. The disparities are evident, yet the fat structures of FGP and LTP2
manifest a striking similarity. Both exhibit continuous, irregular fat
aggregates with “weak” connections, designated as “hot bonds,”
demarcated by black arrows. These bonds undergo a sequential rup-
ture when subjected to mechanical stress. As discussed already ear-
lier,’ these processes are responsible for the texture of foie gras. LTPO

does not have comparable features, and thus the mechanical proper-
ties follow the rules of “hydrodynamic reinforcement” elastic matri-
ces.'° LTP4 has additional features. So-called “hot bonds,” which
carry most of the compression stress” can also be found, but these
are occasionally cross-linked via crystals, as marked by the arrow in
Fig. 12. These correspond to the analogous curve progression
observed in the mechanical compression data, but higher values for
G’. LTP4 shows additional reinforcement by solid crystals, which act
as fiber-like reinforcing particles.’’ Additionally, large, highly crys-
talline clusters, indicated by the yellow ellipse, cause further rein-
forcement at low strains, as suggested in Fig. 7(a). Overall, the
number of large connected cluster for LTP4 is reduced since more
cleaved fatty acids crystallize, which suggests that at larger strains the
elastic response of LTP4 becomes weaker compared to LTP2 and
FGP, as also seen in Fig. 7.

Thus, these CARS data systematically support the observations in
the mechanical experiment, shown in Fig. 7. The LTP2 sample shows
the highest compression force of the samples, which is caused by the
dense percolating network of the sample. In addition to force, which is
needed to break the linked fat aggregates apart, an extensive amount of
force is needed to move the particles along each other.'*

Physics of Fluids

The compression of the LTP4 sample is closer to the FGP sample,
as the emulsion structure resembles the connected fat cluster of the
FGP. However, the high crystal content of the LTP4 samples is respon-
sible for a further increase in the maximum force, as the crystals act as
hard filler particles. The low elastic behavior of the samples LTP4 and
FGP (see LVR in Table V) leads to breaking events of the random fat
network and clusters after the maximum force is reached.

The influence of the emulsion structure on the amplitude sweeps
is contrary to the results of the compression test, as shown in Fig. 7(b).
Whereas the short LVR values can be explained by the initial breaking
of the fat particles at the connection points at low strains, which can be
seen in the images above (see Fig. 12). However, in rheology the FGP
has with G’(0) = 256 800 + 29 400 Pa the highest modulus of the sam-
ples and LTP2 (G’(0) =216700 + 12300 Pa) the lowest modulus.
Considering the fat clusters, the LTP2 should exceed the FGP samples.
However, if shear stress is applied, the solid fat content contributes to
the modulus as well (see Table IV).°* At 5°C the solid fat content of
the FGF is the highest at 57.9 + 3.1% and the lowest for the LTF2 sam-
ple (26.4 + 4.2%), which is even lower than for the LTFO sample.
However, the initial modulus of the LTF2 is around 100 kPa higher
than for the LTPO (see Table V). This is compensated by the dense fat
particle network of the LTP2 sample.

The other important impact of the lipase treatment is given by
the restructuring of the rendered fat, which allows polymorphs of fat
crystals that are more stable and shifts the overall melting regime in
the direction of the foie gras. This can be seen in the DSC experiments,
in the results of WAXS and the persisting X-ray reflexes, which match
those of FG at 37 °C, as shown in Fig. 6.

Finally, a cursory examination of the alterations in the modules
of the rheometer during the process of heating is beneficial, as shown
in Fig. 13. At first sight the curves appear very different from FGP;
however, a complete agreement cannot be expected, since the FGP is a
natural product with a very different preparation history. Nevertheless,
useful features can be extracted, especially in the shaded temperature
regime, which is most relevant for the mouthfeel. FGP shows a very
distinct decrease in the storage modulus G'(t, T’) until complete melt-
ing of the fat, with a very pronounced shoulder between 35 and

42 min. Both lipases-treated samples exhibit a similar behavior, espe-
cially LTP4, which exhibits this pronounced shoulder, too.

The higher moduli of the two patés, LTP2,4 between at
t > 13min is a consequence of the hard crystals, which melt only
around 40°C and higher, completely, as seen in DSC experiments. As
also seen in the CARS experiments, the crystals are more pronounced
for LTP4 than for LTP2. Therefore, LTP4 contains a higher concentra-
tion of hard filler particles, which increases the modulus compared to
LTP2. Despite the higher moduli of LPT2,4, the melting properties
under shear show similar curve shapes in the temperature interval
most relevant for oral processing.

In contrast, the simplest approach, LTPO, the rendered fat emul-
sion, does not show any of these features. Even with the overall
decrease in G’(t, T) remains very low. Simple heated emulsions cannot
mimic FGP sufficiently.

A further question raised by the DSC experiments, and it remains
unresolved within the present investigation. The two melting peaks
appearing after lipase treatment no. 12,13 and 14, 15 require higher
latent heat to melt, as the fat in the foie gras paté after force-feeding, as
shown in Fig. 3. Fats and fat blends with high melting enthalpy may
induce trigeminal cooling in the oral cavity.” The fast-melting pro-
cess takes thermal energy out of the tongue at certain rates, which are
higher than the restoration by the blood circulation. The temperature
may then fall below the thresholds of the trigeminal receptors TRPA1
(cold) and/or TRMP8 (cooling), which induces a cooling sensation.
For fat crystals containing only C 16 and C 18 fatty acids, this is
unlikely, especially when the crystals are embedded in a water-rich
matrix formed by the liver proteins.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the large-scale fat structure is a key element in the
physical behavior of the patés and thus the resulting mouthfeel and
enjoyment. The application of lipase treatment has been demonstrated
to reduce the necessity of force-feeding animals in the production of
foie gras-like paté, which exhibits comparable textural characteristics.
The method of modifying the fat structure and, consequently, the tex-
tural properties of food has emerged as a promising avenue for further
exploration, offering potential applications beyond the scope of this
study.

Nevertheless, precise predictions for the technological formula-
tions are nearly impossible to predict. The reasons are straightforward:
lipases of varying origins, such as from plants, animals, microorgan-
isms, or other sources, exhibit distinct variances in specific activities at
particular process temperatures. Consequently, each lipase batch
necessitates preliminary characterization. Notwithstanding, this inves-
tigation offers a universal strategy to produce non-force-fed foie gras,
which is quasi-equivalent to the original.”

Consequently, the discussion has not addressed flavors and tastes,
as they do not induce substantial alterations in structural properties.
Even when salts (ions) add up to the ionic part of the livers (mono-
and bi-valent ions, free alkaline and acidic amino acids), added salt is
not able to change contributions in the large-scale structure of the fat
network. Adding spices and seasonings from standard (and non-stan-
dard) recipes will provide excellent culinary results. In addition, the
lipase treatment also shows here its strong advantage. The lipase will
cleave short-chain fatty acids, fatty acids with equal or lower molecular
weight than C 12 contributing to the typical smell of non-spiced foie
