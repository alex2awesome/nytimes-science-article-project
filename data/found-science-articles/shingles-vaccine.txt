Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia’ ®.
Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects®°. Here
we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the
occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational
evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine
was determined on the basis of an individual's exact date of birth. Those born before
2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born
onor after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine.
Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage

of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were
merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week
younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the
Zoster vaccine, individuals bornjust 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to
differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in
aregression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced
the probability of anew dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5
percentage points (95% confidence interval (Cl) = 0.6-7.1, P= 0.019), corresponding
toa20.0% (95% Cl = 6.5-33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger
among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population

(England and Wales’s combined population), witha different type of data (death
certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that

is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia

by the healthcare system”®. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this
study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from
zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing
associational evidence.

Recently, evidence has grown that neurotropic herpesviruses may have
arole in the pathogenesis of dementia’ *. One approach to targeting
herpesviruses is vaccination. However, vaccines are also increasingly
being recognized as eliciting a broader immune response that can have
important off-target effects, particularly in the case of live-attenuated
vaccines®®. Such effects have frequently been observed to differ
strongly by sex’.

To date, studies in cohort and electronic health record data on the
effect of vaccination receipt on dementia have simply compared the
occurrence of dementia among those who received a given vaccination
and those who did not". These studies have to assume that all char-
acteristics that are different between those who are vaccinated and
those who are not (and that are also related to dementia) have been

sufficiently well measured and modelled in the analysis, such that no
factors confound the relationship between vaccination receipt and
dementia”. This assumption of no confounding bias is often implausi-
ble because it has to be assumed that the study has detailed data on fac-
tors that are difficult to measure, suchas personal motivation or health
literacy”. It is also an assumption that cannot be empirically verified.

We used a fundamentally different approach that takes advantage of
the fact that, in Wales, starting on 1 September 2013, those born onor
after 2 September 1933 were eligible for herpes zoster vaccination for
at least 1 year, while those born earlier never became eligible’. Using
detailed large-scale electronic health record data, we were able to
compare adults who were ineligible for the vaccine because they were
born immediately before the eligibility cut-off date with those born

immediately after who were eligible. Importantly, individuals who are
only afew weeks apart in age are not expected to differ systematically
from each other. That is, all potential confounding variables are in
expectation balanced between our comparison groups. By taking
advantage of this unique natural experiment, we were able to avoid
confounding more credibly than all existing studies on the topic’,
which have simply compared vaccine recipients to non-recipients
while trying to control for the myriad of differences between these
groups.

Adults born immediately after the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth
eligibility cut-offhad a47.2 percentage point higher probability (from
0.01% to 47.2%) of ever receiving the herpes zoster vaccine than those
born immediately before this cut-off date. As expected, other than
this abrupt change in herpes zoster vaccination uptake, patients were
balanced across the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility thresh-
old in their uptake of other preventive health services, past common
disease diagnoses and educational attainment. We then used this
‘quasi-randomization’ in a regression discontinuity analysis to first
replicate the known finding from clinical trials that the herpes zoster
vaccine reduces new diagnoses of shingles. Second, we extended this
approach to an outcome—dementia—that was never assessed in clinical
trials of the herpes zoster vaccine, and find that the vaccine reduces
the probability of anew dementia diagnosis over a seven-year follow-
up period by approximately one-fifth. Third, we show that the herpes
zoster vaccine did not affect the occurrence of any other common
causes of mortality or morbidity other than shingles and dementia.
Similarly, we show that receipt of the herpes zoster vaccine did not
lead to increased uptake of other vaccinations or preventive health
measures. Fourth, we provide evidence that no other intervention
(such as health insurance eligibility) in Wales used the identical date
of birth (2 September 1933) as eligibility cut-off as was used to define
eligibility for the herpes zoster vaccine. Fifth, we show that all findings
remain similar when using a different analysis approach. Sixth, we show
that changes in healthcare pathways as a result of a shingles episode
are unlikely to explain our findings. Seventh, we provide exploratory
evidence from our electronic health record data on the mechanism
through which herpes zoster vaccination could affect dementia. Our
study focuses on the live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax;
hereafter, zoster vaccine), because the newer recombinant subunit
zoster vaccine (Shingrix) became available in the UK only after our
follow-up period ended”.

Difference in zoster vaccination receipt

We used the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Data-
bank’*, which contains detailed electronic health record data on pri-
mary care visits from approximately 80% of primary care providers
in Wales, linked to secondary care records and the country’s death
register data. The study population for our primary analyses consisted
ofall adults born between 1 September 1925 and 1 September 1942 who
were registered with a primary care provider (which is the case for over
98% of adults residing in Wales”), resided in Wales and did not have
a diagnosis of dementia at the time of the start of the zoster vaccine
program in Wales (on1 September 2013). Basic sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics of the sample of 282,541 adults in our primary
analysis cohort are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

In Wales, individuals born between 2 September 1933 and
1 September 1934 (16,595 adults in our data) became eligible for the
zoster vaccine for at least 1 year on 1 September 2013. Eligibility was
then progressively extended to younger, but not older, age cohorts
annually on the basis of their exact date of birth (Methods).

We find that being born just 1 week after 2 September 1933, and there-
fore being eligible for the zoster vaccine for at least 1 year, caused an
abrupt increase in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vac-
cine from 0.01% to 47.2% (P < 0.001; Fig. 1). This provides a unique

opportunity to avoid confounding concerns because it is unlikely
that individuals born immediately around the date-of-birth eligibility
threshold systematically differ from each other by anything but a one-
week difference in age anda large difference in the probability of receiv-
ing the zoster vaccine. We substantiate this empirically by showing that,
at the time of the start date of the zoster vaccination program, neither
the prevalence of common disease diagnoses (including having been
diagnosed with dementia before the vaccination program rollout),
dementia risk as predicted from a series of clinical and sociodemo-
graphic variables, nor the prevalence of preventive behaviours (other
than zoster vaccine uptake) display a discontinuity at the date-of-birth
eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine (Fig. land Supplementary
Figs. 1-4). Thus, after flexibly controlling for age, our two comparison
groups (onewithalowand onewitha high probability of receiving the
zoster vaccine) born immediately on either side of the 2 September
1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold are probably exchangeable
with each other onall observed and unobserved potential confound-
ing variables.

Our analysis approach primarily compares those who were ineligible
for zoster vaccination because they had their 80th birthday imme-
diately before the program’s start date with those who were eligible
because they had their 80th birthday immediately after the start date.
As is standard practice in regression discontinuity analyses**”’, the
effect of actually receiving the vaccine (as opposed to merely being
eligible) was determined using a two-stage least-squares regression,
which divides the magnitude of the abrupt change in the outcome at
the date-of-birth eligibility threshold by the magnitude of the abrupt
change in vaccine uptake at this threshold (Methods). Thus, the fact
that not all those who were eligible received zoster vaccination does
not bias our analysis.

Zoster vaccination prevents shingles

We first demonstrate that our approach successfully reproduces the
known causal effect from clinical trials that the vaccine reduces the
occurrence of shingles®’. Specifically, using a regression discontinuity
design”®”’, we compared the occurrence of shingles between adults
born close to either side of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for
the zoster vaccine. Consistent with the approach used by clinical trials
of the zoster vaccine*°, our outcome was whether or not an individual
had at least one shingles diagnosis during the follow-up period. Dur-
ing our follow-up period of 7 years, a total of 14,465 among 296,324
adults in our sample had at least one diagnosis of shingles. Over
the same follow-up time, we find that being eligible for the vaccine
reduced the probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis by 1.0
(95% Cl = 0.2-1.7; P= 0.010) percentage point (Fig. 2a), corresponding
toa relative reduction of 18.8% (95% Cl = 8.8-28.9). When calculating
the effect of actually receiving the zoster vaccine, we find a reduc-
tion in the probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis of 2.3
(95% Cl = 0.5-3.9; P= 0.011) percentage points over the seven-year
follow-up period (Fig. 2b); an effect (37.2% (95% CI =19.7-54.7) in rela-
tive terms) that is similar in size to that observed in clinical trials of the
live-attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax)*°.

We show that our estimated effect is not sensitive to the chosen func-
tional form of the regression used to model the relationship of shingles
occurrence with week of birth (Supplementary Fig. 5), the width of the
week-of-birth window (bandwidth) around the date-of-birth eligibil-
ity cut-off that defines our analysis sample (Supplementary Fig. 6a)
or to different grace periods (Fig. 2c). With ‘grace periods’, we refer
to time periods since the index date after which the follow-up time
is considered to begin (Methods). There was also a strong indication
that the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of having at least one
diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (acommon complication of shin-
gles), although this effect did not reach statistical significance in all
specifications (Supplementary Fig. 7).

New diagnoses of dementia

Given the neuropathological overlap between dementia types and the
difficulty in distinguishing dementia types clinically®, as well as our
reduced statistical power when studying less-common outcomes, we
defined dementia as dementia of any type or cause as our outcome.
We considered an individual to have developed dementia ifthere was a
new diagnosis of dementia in our electronic health record data (which
includes all diagnoses made in primary or secondary care) or dementia
was listed as a primary or contributory cause of death on the death
certificate. The Read and ICD-10-codes used to define dementia are
listed in the Supplementary Codes. During our seven-year follow-up
period, 35,307 among 282,541 adults in our sample were newly diag-
nosed with dementia.

Using our regression discontinuity approach, we estimate that the
effect of being eligible for the zoster vaccine is a1.3 (95% Cl=0.2-2.7;
P=0.022) percentage points absolute and 8.5% (95% CI =1.9-15.1) rel-
ative reduction in the probability of anew dementia diagnosis over
7 years (Fig. 3a). Scaled to account for the fact that not all those who
were eligible received the vaccine, we find that actually receiving the
zoster vaccine reduced the probability of anew dementia diagnosis
by 3.5 (95% CI = 0.6-7.1; P= 0.019) percentage points, correspond-
ing to a relative reduction of 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5-33.4) (Fig. 3b).
The effect estimates were generally not sensitive to different grace
periods (Fig. 3c), the functional form of our regressions (Supplementary
Fig. 8) nor the width of the week-of-birth window (bandwidth) drawn
around the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
We also find significant effects of the zoster vaccine on reducing

dementia diagnoses if a diagnosis is defined solely as a new prescrip-
tion of amedication (donepezil hydrochloride, galantamine, rivastig-
mine or memantine hydrochloride) that is frequently prescribed to
slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (Supplementary Table 2
(column 2)). Similarly, the effects remain similar when adjusting for
all input variables to the Dementia Risk Score” (as recorded before
1September 2013) (Supplementary Table 2 (column 7)).

Other interventions using an identical cut-off

The key strength of our study is that a confounding variable can bias
our analysis only if the variable changes abruptly at the 2 Septem-
ber 1933 date-of-birth threshold**”’. Thus, confounding bias could
occur if another intervention also used the date of birth cut-off of
2 September 1933 as an eligibility criterion. Such an intervention is
unlikely to affect only the risk of developing dementia without also influ-
encing other health outcomes. We therefore implemented the same
regression discontinuity approach as we did for shingles and dementia
for the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality
for the age group 70+ years in Wales in 2019”, and all conditions that are
part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index™. As shown in Supplementary
Figs. 9 and 10, we generally do not detect effects of zoster vaccination
on new diagnoses of these other common health outcomes.

We undertook four additional types of analysis, all of which pro-
vide evidence against another intervention having used the identical
day-month-year combination (2 September 1933) as was used as the
date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine rollout. First,
we show that the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold does not

probability of having at least one shingles diagnosis during the follow-up
period. For a, the MSE-optimal bandwidth is 145.7 weeks (95,227 adults). The
grey dots show the mean value for each 10-week increment in week of birth. The
grey shading of the dots is proportionate to the weight that observations from

affect the probability of taking up other preventive health interventions
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Second, we examined whether the day-month
(that is, 2 September) date-of-birth cut-off used for zoster vaccine eli-
gibility was also used by other interventions that affect dementia risk.
We did so by implementing the identical analysis as for 1 September
2013 (the actual date on which the zoster vaccine program started) for
1September of each of the three years before and after 2013. Thus, for
example, when shifting the start date of the program to 1 September
2012, we compared those around the 2 September 1932 date-of-birth
threshold with the follow-up period starting on 1 September 2012.
As an additional check that enabled us to maintain the length of the
seven-year follow-up period used in our primary analyses, we shifted
the program start date to 1 September of each of the 6 years preceding
(but not after) 2013. As expected, for both of these checks, we find a
significant effect on dementia occurrence only for the date-of-birth
cutoff (2 September 1933) that was actually used by the zoster vac-
cination program (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Third, we find that
there is no difference in the seven-year incidence of dementia between
age cohorts around the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold for
the seven-year period before the zoster vaccine rollout (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14). Fourth, using data from the 2011 Census, we show in Sup-
plementary Figs. 15-17 that there are no discontinuities across the
2 September 1933 threshold in the proportion of individuals in Wales
who reached a particular level of education.

Robustness to a different analytical approach

As anadditional test of the robustness of our findings, we implemented
all primary analyses using a difference-in-differences instrumental
variable analysis (DID-IV) that takes advantage of the fact that the
only 2 September date-of-birth threshold at which we would expect

anabrupt change in the outcome is the 2 September threshold in 1933
(that is, the day-month-year combination that was used as eligibility
cut-off by the zoster vaccination program). In doing so, our analysis
relaxes the continuity assumption of regression discontinuity (that
is, the assumption that potential confounding variables do not dis-
play a sudden change at the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibil-
ity threshold), and instead assumes that (in the absence of the zoster
vaccination program) a possible discontinuity in the outcome at the
2 September 1933 threshold is not different in size from a discontinu-
ity at the 2 September threshold in previous birth years. Details of our
approach are provided in the Methods. Encouragingly, the effect of
zoster vaccine receipt on the probability of anew dementia diagnosis
during our seven-year follow-up period is remarkably similar between
the DID-IV and regression discontinuity approach (-3.1 (95% CI = -5.8 to
-0.4,P= 0.024) versus -3.5 (95% Cl = -7.1to -0.6, P= 0.019) percentage
points) (Fig. 4). This is also the case for the outcomes of shingles and
postherpetic neuralgia (Fig. 4). We conducted the same checks for bal-
ance in health characteristics between our comparison groups for the
DID-IV as we implemented for our regression discontinuity analyses
(Supplementary Fig. 18). We also verified that our DID-IV approach
yields significant effects only for the outcomes of dementia, shingles
and postherpetic neuralgia, but not for any other common health
outcomes (Supplementary Fig. 18).

Explorations of the effect mechanism

Aprotective effect of zoster vaccination on dementia diagnoses could
arise from three (non-mutually exclusive) mechanisms: (1) changes
in healthcare pathways as a result of a shingles episode; (2) a reduc-
tion in reactivations of the varicella zoster virus (VZV); and (3) a
VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect (for example, one

these mechanisms.

Changes in healthcare after shingles

Reduced healthcare use resulting averted shingles episodes from zoster
vaccination receipt could have translated to fewer opportunities for
the health system to (1) diagnose dementia (ascertainment bias); or
(2) implement care changes (for example, initiation of anew medica-
tion) that increase the risk of being diagnosed with dementia in the
future. It is important to point out that this mechanism is unlikely to
fully explain our findings, because the size of our effect estimates for

reductions in shingles episodes from zoster vaccination were consid-
erably too small to plausibly account for the observed reduction in
dementia diagnoses.

We nonetheless conducted five types of analysis to examine this
potential mechanism further. First, if shingles episodes presented an
opportunity for the health system to diagnose dementia, then they
would probably also present an opportunity to diagnose other chronic
conditions. We therefore applied the same regression discontinuity

one-year increments in the follow-up period. With the exception of
rheumatological diseases, we show that being eligible for the zoster vac-
cine did not have an effect on new chronic disease diagnoses (Supple-
mentary Fig. 19). Second, we adjusted our regressions for the frequency
of health service use (the number of primary care visits, outpatient
visits, hospital admissions and influenza vaccinations received) dur-
ing the follow-up period, which did not substantially change our effect
estimates (Supplementary Table 2 (column 4)). Third, we implemented
our analyses when restricting the analysis cohort to the 247,784 (87.6%
of the analysis cohort for our primary analyses) patients who visited
their primary care provider at least once a year during each of the5 years
before the start of the zoster vaccine rollout. The rationale for this
analysis is that, among patients who already interact frequently with
the health system, a reduction of one further contact with the health
system due to an averted shingles episode is less likely to affect the prob-
ability of detecting undiagnosed dementia. The effect sizes among this
cohort of frequent healthcare users remain similar to those in our pri-
mary analytical cohort (Supplementary Table 2 (column 3)). Fourth, we
added whether individuals experienced a shingles episode during the
follow-up period asa covariate in our primary regression discontinuity
analysis. We found that adjusting our analysis for shingles episodes did
not substantially change our point estimate (Supplementary Fig. 20).
Fifth, we implemented an event study among those participants in the
mean-squared-error (MSE)-optimal bandwidth of our primary regres-
sion discontinuity analysis for dementia who received a shingles diag-
nosis during the follow-up period. To investigate whether episodes of
shingles led to changes in healthcare received by patients, we examined
the effect of the shingles diagnosis on the following outcomes in each
of the 36 months after the diagnosis: (1) the probability of receiving a
new dementia diagnosis; (2) a set of indicators of health service use;
(3) the probability of receiving anew medication prescription for anti-
viral drugs, opioid medications, gabapentin or pregabalin, and any of
216 medications that were associated with an increased risk of dementia
in another analysis in the SAIL database”’; and (4) the probability of
being diagnosed with any of the chronic conditions that are part of
the Charlson Comorbidity Index**. We found that shingles diagnoses
did not increase the probability of receiving a new dementia diagnosis
inthe months after the shingles diagnosis, and led to only short-term
increases in healthcare service use and new medication prescriptions
(Supplementary Fig. 21). The increase in the probability of receiving a
gabapentin or pregabalin prescription inthe months after the shingles
episode, while more sustained, was small in magnitude. Similarly, the
increase in the probability of being diagnosed with any chronic condi-
tioninthe month ofa shingles episode compared with the month before
the episode was less than one percentage point (Supplementary Fig. 21).

As the effect of zoster vaccination on shingles episodes is moderate
(Fig. 2), and the five types of analysis in this section document only small
and short-lived effects of shingles episodes on healthcare pathways,
even the most conservative assumptions about the effect of these care
paths on dementia imply that changes in healthcare as a result of a
shingles episode cannot explain our findings.

Reduction in reactivations of VZV

As described in the previous section, adjusting our regression disconti-
nuity analysis for whether a patient hada record of at least one shingles
episode during the follow-up period did not change our point estimate
substantially (Supplementary Fig. 20). However, conclusions from this
analysis regarding reductions in VZV reactivations as the effect mecha-
nism are limited by the fact that (1) zoster vaccination probably reduces
both clinical as well as subclinical reactivations of VZV"; and (2) hav-
ing ashingles episode may be an unreliable indicator of the degree of
subclinical VZV reactivations experienced during the entire follow-up
period, given that shingles episodes may boost immunity for VZV".
We therefore conducted the following analyses to further examine
reductions in VZV reactivations as the effect mechanism.

6 | Nature | www.nature.com

First, we examined the time during the follow-up period at which the
effect of zoster vaccination on dementia appears to begin. Specifically,
among patients who were born in close proximity to the 2 September
1933 date-of-birth threshold, we plotted the Kaplan-Meier and cumula-
tive incidence curves for dementia for those who were eligible versus
ineligible for zoster vaccination (Methods). If the effect mechanism
is through a reduction in VZV reactivations, then one would expect
that the effects of the vaccine on reductions in clinical and subclinical
reactivations of the virus would begin before observing an effect on
dementia. The live-attenuated zoster vaccine is thought to begin being
efficacious within weeks after vaccine administration****. Consistent
with the principle that the effect on VZV reactivations should precede
the dementia effect, we observe that the reduction in the incidence of
dementia begins to emerge only after more than one year, both among
the full population as well as among women only (Supplementary
Fig. 22).

Second, whilea shingles episode may boost VZVimmunity and, there-
fore, reduce subsequent subclinical VZV reactivations*®”>, individu-
als who experience multiple episodes as opposed to a single shingles
episode during the follow-up period probably experience a greater
degree of both clinical and subclinical VZV reactivations during the
follow-up period”’. Using propensity score matching (Methods), we
therefore compared the association with dementia from experiencing
multiple versus a single shingles episode. We find a higher incidence of
dementia among those who experienced multiple shingles episodes
(Supplementary Fig. 23).

Third, if VZV reactivations increase the risk of dementia, then limiting
the degree of replication of the virus during a shingles episode through
antiviral medication could be expected to decrease dementia incidence.
Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (Methods), we
therefore compared the association with dementia between individuals
whose shingles episode was treated with antiviral medication and those
for whom the episode was untreated. We find that antiviral treatment of
ashingles episode is associated with a reduced incidence of dementia
(Supplementary Fig. 23).

VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect

To probe this mechanism, we take advantage of two observations on
pathogen-independent immunomodulatory effects from vaccination
in the literature: they tend to (1) vary strongly by sex, with beneficial
effects from live-attenuated vaccination often seen only in female but
not male individuals® §; and (2) depend on the receipt of other vaccines
before, or at the same time as, receipt of the vaccine in question® *.
Consistent with these observations, we find that the effect of zoster
vaccination on new diagnoses of dementia was markedly greater among
women than men (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3 (column 1)). There
was no significant difference between women and menin the effect of
the zoster vaccine on diagnoses of shingles and postherpetic neural-
gia (Supplementary Table 3 (columns 2 and 3)). Similarly, the magni-
tude of the abrupt increase in vaccine uptake at the 2 September 1933
date-of-birth eligibility threshold was comparable between women
and men (Supplementary Fig. 24), witha slightly larger magnitude
among men.

Wealso find strong effect heterogeneity by receipt of previous influ-
enza vaccination. Specifically, the protective effect of zoster vaccina-
tion for dementia was larger among those who did not recently receive
the influenza vaccine (Supplementary Fig. 25). Influenza vaccination is
the only vaccine that was provided within the 5 years preceding zoster
vaccination eligibility to a substantial proportion of individuals in our
study population (pneumococcal vaccination is already provided at
age 65 years in the United Kingdom”).

Finally, we examined the differences in the effect of the zoster vac-
cine on dementia incidence between those with versus without an
autoimmune orallergic condition. Our reasoning for this analysis was
based on the observation that the incidence of shingles is increased

autoimmune condition will likely benefit equally or more than those
without such a condition. However, because autoimmune and aller-
gic conditions are generally characterized by a heightened activation
of the (adaptive) immune system, individuals with such a condi-
tion might benefit less from further activation of more generalized,

acondition. Consistent with this second hypothesis, we observe sug-
gestive evidence for stronger effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for
dementia among those without an autoimmune or allergic condition
than those with sucha condition (Supplementary Fig. 25). The patterns
that we observe remain largely unaffected by whether or not patients
were taking any immunosuppressive medications in the year preceding
the start of the zoster vaccination program.

Thus, overall and with the caveat that these exploratory analyses are
suggestive only, our analyses indicate that botha mechanism of action
through a reduction in clinical and subclinical reactivations of VZV as
wellas through a VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect are plau-
sible. Importantly, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.

Discussion

Here we found that the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a
new dementia diagnosis by approximately one-fifth over a seven-year
follow-up period. By taking advantage of the fact that the unique way in
which the zoster vaccine was rolled out in Wales constitutes a natural
experiment, and examining each possible remaining source of bias,
our study provides evidence that is more likely to be causal in nature
than the existing, exclusively associational’*™, evidence on this topic.
Our substantial effect sizes, combined with the relatively low cost of
the zoster vaccine, imply that, if these findings are truly causal, the
zoster vaccine will be both far more effective as well as cost-effective
in preventing or delaying dementia than existing pharmaceutical
interventions.

Our quasi-experimental approach reduces the probability of con-
founding compared with more standard associational analyses. Moreo-
ver, we have provided evidence froma series of analyses against any of
the possible remaining sources of bias being a likely explanation of our
findings. Nonetheless, it is possible (even if statistically unlikely) that
our findings are due to chance. Confirmation of our findings in other
populations, settings and data sources is therefore critical. Impor-
tantly, we have successfully confirmed our findings using country-wide
death certificate data from England and Wales”°. Specifically, because
England rolled out the zoster vaccine in an almost identical way to
Wales“, we were able to use the same quasi-experimental approach
as in our electronic health record data from Wales to determine the
effect of eligibility for zoster vaccination based on one’s date of birthon
deaths for which the underlying cause was recorded as being dementia.
We found that, over a nine-year follow-up period, approximately lin
20 such deaths were averted from being eligible for zoster vaccina-
tion. This study constitutes an important confirmation of our results
because it analysed a different population (England’s population
accounts for approximately 95% of England’s and Wales’s combined
population‘), type of data (death certificates as opposed to electronic
health records) and outcome (deaths due to dementia). In addition
to this confirmation of our results in mortality data, the probability
of achance finding is further reduced by the fact that we successfully
replicate our main findings using asecond analysis approach (DID-IV)
and that our effect sizes remain stable across a multitude of analysis
choices, including choice of grace periods, follow-up periods, study
population definitions (for example, restriction to frequent healthcare
users), functional form of our regressions, width of the week-of-birth
window drawn around the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off and index date
definitions.

We observed large differences in the effect of zoster vaccination on
dementia between women and men, with women benefitting more than
men. In our view, these large differences between women and men are
plausible for several reasons. First, we cannot exclude the possibility
of substantial reductions in new dementia diagnoses from zoster vac-
cination among men, especially given the lower incidence of dementia
in older age among men than women in our data and, therefore, our
wider confidence intervals for analyses among men. Second, off-target

effects of vaccines have often been observed to be far stronger among
female than male individuals, with female individuals benefiting more
from live-attenuated vaccines in particular®’. Third, there appear to be
important sex differences in the immunological response to vaccines
more generally*®. Lastly, there is a growing body of evidence that there
may be differences in the pathogenesis of dementia between women
and men®.

Other than investing into randomized trials, investments into basic
science research on the potential role of VZV and the immune response
to the zoster vaccine in the pathogenesis of dementia could provide
critical mechanistic insights. There are already several lines of evi-
dence on plausible mechanistic pathways that link VZV reactivations
to dementia. Specifically, VZV reactivations have been found to lead to
long-lasting cognitive impairment through vasculopathy**”, amyloid
deposition and aggregation of tau proteins®, neuroinflammation™ *,
as well as a similar spectrum of cerebrovascular disease as seen in
Alzheimer’s disease, including small to large vessel disease, ischaemia,
infarction and haemorrhage***. As suggested by a recent study”, it may
also be the case that reducing subclinical and clinical reactivations of
VZV reduces reactivations of the herpes simplex virus-1in the brain
through neuroinflammatory pathways. This mechanism would link
VZV to the body of literature on the role of herpes simplex virus-1in the
pathogenesis of dementia’ *. Nonetheless, our exploratory analyses on
the effect mechanism that links zoster vaccination to dementia suggest
that botha mechanism through reducing clinical and subclinical reacti-
vations of VZV as well as a pathogen-independent immune mechanism
are plausible. Some of these possible pathogen-independent immune
mechanisms have recently been detailed elsewhere™.

Our study has several limitations. First, our outcome ascertainment
probably suffers from some degree of under-detection, both in whether
and in how timely a fashion dementia is diagnosed. Importantly,
because the probability of under-detecting dementia, as well as the
delay in doing so, is unlikely to change abruptly at the 2 September 1933
date-of-birth eligibility threshold for zoster vaccination, this outcome
misclassification is most likely non-differential. Our effect estimates
are therefore likely to be conservative (that is, our absolute effect sizes
would be an underestimate of the true absolute effect magnitude).
Similarly, changes in the accuracy and timeliness of dementia ascer-
tainment over the years of our follow-period, such as due to chang-
ing clinical practice or health system incentives to detect and record
dementia, affected those bornimmediately before versus immediately
after 2 September 1933 equally. We would therefore not expect these
changes to be a source of bias in our analyses. Second, we are unable
to provide estimates for the effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for
reducing dementia occurrence in age groups other than those who
were weighted most heavily in our regression discontinuity analyses
(primarily those aged 79 to 80 years). Third, the COVID-19 pandemic
probably affected the timeliness with which dementia was diagnosed.
However, the follow-up period used in our primary analyses ended
before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, because the
pandemic affected those bornjust before versus just after 2 September
1933 equally, pandemic-related under-detection of dementia is unlikely
to bias our relative effect estimates. Fourth, we were limited to a maxi-
mum follow-up period of 8 years. Our study can therefore not inform
onthe effectiveness of the zoster vaccine for reducing dementia occur-
rence beyond this time period. Lastly, because the newer recombinant
subunit zoster vaccine (Shingrix) replaced the live-attenuated zoster
vaccine (Zostavax) in the United Kingdom only in September 2023”,
which is after our follow-up period ended, our effect estimates apply
to the live-attenuated zoster vaccine only.

Description of the zoster vaccine rollout in Wales

The live-attenuated zoster vaccine (Zostavax) was made available to
eligible individuals in Wales through a staggered rollout system start-
ing on1 September 2013. Under this system, individuals aged 71 years
or older were categorized into three groups on 1 September of each
year: (1) an ineligible cohort of those aged 71 to 78 years (or 77 years,
depending on the year of the program), who became eligible in the
future; (2) a catch-up cohort, consisting of individuals aged 79 years
(or 78 years, again depending on the year of the program); and (3) those
whowere ineligible as they were aged 80 years or older and who never
became eligible.

Our analysis focused on adults born between 1 September 1925 (88
years old at program start) and 1 September 1942 (71 years old at pro-
gram start). Those born between 1 September 1925 and 1 September
1933 never became eligible, whereas those born between 2 September
1933 and 1September 1942 became progressively eligible ina catch-up
cohort. Specifically, the vaccine was offered to those born between
2 September 1933 and 1 September 1934 in the first year of the program
(1September 2013 to 31 August 2014); those born between 2 September
1934 and 1 September 1936 in the second year (1 September 2014 to 31
August 2015); those born between 2 September 1936 and1September
1937 in the third year (1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016); and those
born between 2 September 1937 and 1 September 1938 in the fourth
year (1 September 2016 to 31 August 2017). As of 1 April 2017, individu-
als become eligible for the vaccine on their 78th birthday and remain
eligible until their 80th birthday. Our analysis principally compared
individuals born on or shortly after 2 September 1933, to individuals
who never became eligible as they were born shortly before 2Septem-
ber 1933. We show in Supplementary Figs. 26-28 that most eligible
individuals, especially in the first two eligibility cohorts, which are the
focus of our analysis, took up the vaccination during their first year
of eligibility (as opposed to during later years) and that vaccination
uptake in these first two eligibility cohorts was ofa similar magnitude.

Data source

Healthcare in Wales is provided through the Welsh National Health
Service (NHS), which is part of the United Kingdom’s single-payer
single-provider healthcare system®’. NHS Wales and Swansea Univer-
sity created the SAIL Databank”*°“*, which includes full electronic
health record data for primary care visits linked to information on
hospital-based care as well as the country’s death register data.

SAIL generates alist of all individuals who have ever been registered
with a primary care provider in Wales (which is the case for over 98%
of adults residing in Wales”’) from the Welsh Demographic Service
Dataset®. SAIL then links this universe of individuals to each of the
following datasets. Electronic health record data from primary care
providers is made available in SAIL through the Welsh Longitudinal
General Practice dataset®’, which contains data from approximately
80% of primary care practices in Wales and 83% of the Welsh popula-
tion. These electronic health record data use Read codes, which provide
detailed information on patients and their care encounters, including
diagnoses, clinical signs and observations, symptoms, laboratory tests
and results, procedures performed and administrative items”. Zoster
vaccination was defined using both codes for the administration of the
vaccine as well as product codes (Supplementary Table 1). Diagnoses
made and procedures performed in the hospital setting (as part of
inpatient admissions or day-case procedures) are provided in SAIL
through linkage to the Patient Episode Database for Wales*’, which
begins in 1991 and contains data for all hospital-based care in Wales
as well as hospital-based care provided in England to Welsh residents.
Procedures are encoded using OPCS-4 codes® and diagnoses using
ICD-10 codes”’. Attendance information at any NHS Wales hospital
outpatient department is provided through linkage to the Outpatient

Database for Wales”, which starts in2004. ICD-10-encoded diagnoses of
cancers are identified through linkage to the Welsh Cancer Intelligence
and Surveillance Unit”, which is the national cancer registry for Wales
that records all cancer diagnoses provided to Welsh residents wherever
they were diagnosed or treated. This dataset begins in 1994. Finally,
cause-of-death data are provided for all Welsh residents (regardless of
where they died in the United Kingdom) through linkage to the Annual
District Death Extract”, which begins in 1996 and includes primary and
contributory causes of death from death certificates. Dates for deaths
were those on which the death was registered, as opposed to when it
occurred. Cause-of-death data use ICD-9 coding until 2001 and ICD-10
coding thereafter.

When testing for any discontinuities in educational attainment across
the date-of-birth eligibility threshold, we used a dataset provided
by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This dataset was gener-
ated by the ONS from the 2011 UK Census for all usual residents aged
16 or over, born in Wales between January 1925 and December 1950,
regardless of their employment status. The data were categorized by
the ONS by sex, month and year of birth (January 1925 to December
1950), highest level of qualification and occupation.

Ethics approval was granted by the Information Governance Review
Panel (IGRP, application number, 1306). Composed of government,
regulatory and professional agencies, the IGRP oversees and approves
applications to use the SAIL databank. All analyses were approved and
considered minimal risk by the Stanford University Institutional Review
Board on 9 June 2023 (protocol number, 70277).

Study cohort, follow-up period and loss to follow-up

Our study population consisted of 296,603 individuals born between
1September 1925 and 1 September 1942 who were registered witha
primary care provider in Wales on the start date of the zoster vaccine
program rollout (1 September 2013). As we only had access to the date
of the Monday of the week in which an individual was born, we were
unable to determine whether the individuals born in the cut-off week
starting on 28 August 1933 were eligible for the zoster vaccine in the
first year of its rollout. We therefore excluded 279 individuals bornin
this particular week. Among the remaining individuals, 13,783 hada
diagnosis of dementia before 1 September 2013 and were therefore
excluded from the analyses with new diagnoses of dementia as out-
come. The size of our final analysis cohort for all primary analyses for
new dementia diagnoses was therefore 282,541. This analysis cohort
was used forall analyses except those with incidence of dementia before
zoster vaccination program start, shingles and postherpetic neuralgia
as outcomes; analyses for which we did not exclude individuals witha
dementia diagnosis before 1 September 2013.

We followed individuals from 1 September 2013 to 31 August 2021,
which allowed for a maximum follow-up period of 8 years. In our pri-
mary specification, we selected a follow-up period of 7 years (that is,
until 31 August 2020) because this enabled us to include grace periods
of up to 12 months while still keeping the follow-up period constant
for individuals on either side of the date-of-birth eligibility cut-off.
However, we also show all results for follow-up periods from one to
eight years in one-year increments. Owing to the unique anonymized
NHS number assigned to each patient, we were able to follow individu-
als across time even if they changed primary care provider. Patients
were therefore only lost to follow-up in our cohort if they emigrated
out of Wales or changed to one of the approximately 20% of primary
care practices in Wales that did not contribute data to SAIL. Over our
seven-year follow-up period, this was the case for 23,049 (8.2%) of
adults in our primary analysis cohort, with no significant difference
in this proportion between those born just before versus just after the
2 September 1933 eligibility threshold. In total, 92,629 (37.8%) of adults
in our primary analysis cohort died during the seven-year follow-up
period. Our primary analysis approach does not adjust for any compet-
ing risk of death for three reasons. First and foremost, in the absence

of azoster vaccination program, there is no reason that the competing
risk of death should differ across the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth
eligibility threshold. Second, not adjusting for competing risk of death
in our setting is a conservative choice because eligibility for zoster vac-
cination may reduce (but is very unlikely to increase) all-cause mortal-
ity”. Thus, those eligible for zoster vaccination will, on average, be
exposed toa longer time period during which they could become newly
diagnosed with dementia. Third, to date, no well-established approach
exists for survival analysis in a regression discontinuity framework,
including the ability to determine the CACE and optimal bandwidth”.

Definition of outcomes

Owing to the neuropathological overlap between dementia types and
difficulty in distinguishing dementia types clinically” ”’, we chose
to define dementia as dementia of any type or cause. Dementia was
defined as a diagnosis of dementia made either in primary care (as
recorded in the primary care electronic health record data), specialist
care or hospital-based care, or dementia being named asa primary or
contributory cause of death on the death certificate. The date of the
first recording of dementia across any of these data sources was used
to define the date on which the patient was diagnosed with dementia.
Similarly, all other outcomes were defined using a diagnosis made in
any care setting or mentioning as a primary or contributory cause of
death. For chronic conditions, the date of the first recording across
any of these data sources was used to define the date on which the
chronic condition occurred. For non-chronic conditions or events
(that is, shingles, postherpetic neuralgia, stroke, lower respiratory tract
infections, falls, lower back pain, medication prescriptions, influenza
vaccination and breast cancer screening), the date of first recording
after the program date across any of these data sources was used for
defining the occurrence of the outcome during the follow-up. The
Read and ICD-10 codes used to define all outcomes are detailed in the
Supplementary Codes.

Statistical analysis

The two authors who analysed the data (M.E. and M.X.) have coded
all parts of the analysis independently. Occasional minor differences,
resulting from different data coding choices, were resolved through
discussion.

Our regression discontinuity approach. We used a regression discon-
tinuity design to analyse our data, which is a well-established method
for causal inference in the social sciences*®. Regression discontinu-
ity analysis estimates expected outcome probabilities just left and
just right of the cut-off, to obtain an estimate of the treatment effect.
We used local linear triangular kernel regressions (assigning a higher
weight to observations lying closer to the date-of-birth eligibility
threshold) in our primary analyses and quadratic polynomials in ro-
bustness checks. This is the recommended and most robust approach
for regression discontinuity analyses even in situations in which the
relationship between the assignment variable (here, date of birth)
and the outcome is exponential®. An important choice in regression
discontinuity analyses is the width of the data window (the bandwidth)
that is drawn around the threshold. Following standard practice, we
used an MSE-optimal bandwidth®, which minimizes the MSEs of the
regression fit, in our primary analyses. We determined this optimal
bandwidth separately for each combination of sample and outcome
definition. In robustness checks, we examined the degree to which our
point estimates vary across different bandwidth choices ranging from
0.25 times to two times the MSE-optimal bandwidth. We used robust
bias-corrected standard errors for inference.

Estimating the effect of being eligible for the zoster vaccine. In
the first step, we determined the effect of being eligible for the zos-
ter vaccine (regardless of whether the individual actually received

the vaccine) on our outcomes. To do so, we estimated the following
regression equation:

¥,=a+ B, x D;+ B, x (WOB;- c,) + B, x D; x (WOB;- Co) + ;, 60)

where Y, is a binary variable equal to one if an individual experienced
the outcome (for example, shingles or dementia). The binary variable
D, indicates eligibility for the zoster vaccine and is equal to one if an
individual was born on or after the cut-off date of 2 September 1933.
The term (WOB; - C,) indicates an individual's week of birth centred
around the cut-off date. The interaction term D, x (WOB; — Cy) allows
for the slope of the regression line to differ on either side of the thresh-
old. The parameter £, identifies the absolute effect of being eligible
for the vaccine on the outcome. Wherever we report relative effects,
we calculated these by dividing the absolute effect estimate B, by the
mean outcome just left of the date-of-birth eligibility threshold, that
is, the estimate of a.

Estimating the effect of actually receiving the zoster vaccine. Inthe
second step, we estimated the effect of actually receiving the zoster
vaccine on our outcomes. This effect is commonly referred to as the
complier average causal effect (CACE) in the econometrics literature™.
As is standard practice™, we used a fuzzy regression discontinuity
design to estimate the CACE. Fuzzy regression discontinuity analysis
takes into account the fact that the vaccine is not deterministically
assigned at the week-of-birth cut-off. Instead, a proportion of ineligible
individuals still received the vaccine and a proportion of eligible indi-
viduals did not receive the vaccine. To account for this fuzziness in the
assignment, the fuzzy regression discontinuity design uses aninstru-
mental variable approach, with the instrumental variable being the
binary variable that indicates whether or not an individual was eligible
toreceive the vaccine, that is, is born on or after 2 September 1933. As we
verify in our plot of vaccine receipt by week of birth (Fig. 1a), individuals
whowere bornimmediately after the date-of-birth eligibility threshold
had a far higher probability of receiving the zoster vaccine compared
with those born immediately before the threshold. Other than the
abrupt change in the probability of receiving the zoster vaccine, there
probably is no other difference in characteristics that affect the prob-
ability of our outcomes occurring between those born immediately
after versus immediately before the date-of-birth eligibility threshold.
Thus, the indicator variable for the date-of-birth eligibility threshold
is a valid instrumental variable to identify the causal effect of receipt
of the zoster vaccine on our outcomes. To compare the probability of
experiencing the outcome between those who actually received the
zoster vaccine versus those who did not, the instrumental variable
estimation scales the effect size for being eligible for the zoster vac-
cine by the size of the abrupt change in the probability of receiving the
vaccine at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. The size of the jump
is estimated through the following first-stage regression equation:

V;= y + 0.x D;+ 8, (WOB; - C,) + 83 x D; x (WOB; — Co) + €;, (2)

where Vis a binary variable indicating whether the individual received
the zoster vaccine and 8, identifies the discontinuous increase in vac-
cine receipt at the date-of-birth eligibility threshold. All other param-
eters are the same as in regression (1).

The CACE estimated by rescaling the effect of eligibility with the
first-stage effect from equation (2) canbe represented as an IV estimate
for 4, from the following second-stage regression:

Y= + 1, * V+", x (WOB;-c,) +11, *D;x (WOB-Co) +e, (3)
where’; is the predicted probability of zoster vaccine receipt obtained

from the first-stage estimation from equation (2). This CACE, p,, rep-
resents the (absolute) average causal effect of receiving the vaccine

among compliers, that is, patients who take up the vaccine if and only
if they are eligible.

To compute relative effect sizes, we first introduce some notation.
Let R,, be the mean outcome among unvaccinated compliers and R,,.
the mean outcome among vaccinated compliers just at the threshold.
By definition, the absolute CACE is 1, = R,,.— Ry,-and the relative effect
is /._ To estimate the relative effect, we need an estimate for R,.. While
it ig ; impossible to identify compliers individually, we can estimate
means of their observable characteristics, including Ro, (ref. 85). Let
R, denote the mean outcome amongall vaccinated individuals (includ-
ing compliers) at the cut-off. Assuming no defiers exist (patients who
get vaccinated ifand only if they are not eligible), all vaccinated people
are either compliers or always-takers (patients who get vaccinated
irrespective of their eligibility). Thus, R, is equal to the population-
weighted average of the mean outcomes among vaccinated compliers
and always-takers: R, = P, x Ri, + Pa x Rig, Where P,and P, are the popu-
lation share of the compliers and always-takers and R,,, is the mean
outcome among always-takers at the cut-off. Solving for R,, yields
R= Aina Te All right-hand-side quantities in this equation can be
estimated from data. First, R, and R,,, can be estimated, respectively,
asa + B,and a from re-estimating regression (1) only among vaccinated
individuals. Second, P, and P, can be estimated, respectively, as 7

and 51 a ; from regression (2). Finally, we estimate R,,.by the above for.
mula and Ry, ¢=R,c~ fh. The relative effect is estimated as“! . All regres-

sions involved in these steps can be stacked and jointly estimated, so
that the relative effect is expressed as a differentiable function of known
estimators a 95% confidence interval of the relative CACE can be esti-
mated using the delta method®*.

Analyses to investigate whether another intervention used the
identical date-of-birth eligibility cut-off. Our analysis can only be
confounded if the confounding variable changes abruptly at the
2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold such that indi-
viduals very close to either side of this threshold would no longer be
exchangeable with each other. The most plausible scenario of sucha
confounding variable would be the existence of an intervention that
used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility threshold as the zoster
vaccine rollout and that also affected the probability of adementia
diagnosis during our follow-up period. We conducted five analyses to
demonstrate that the existence of such an intervention is unlikely, by
establishing that measures of outcomes and behaviours that would be
affected by such an intervention are smooth across the date-of-birth
eligibility cut-off.

First, across a range of birthdates around the 2 September 1933 eli-
gibility threshold, we plotted the probability of having received the
following diagnoses or interventions before the start of the zoster
vaccine program (on 1 September 2013): diagnosis of shingles, influ-
enza vaccine receipt in the preceding 12 months, receipt of the pneu-
mococcal vaccine as an adult, current statin use (defined as a new or
repeat prescription of a statin in the 3 months preceding program
start), current use of an antihypertensive medication (defined as a
newor repeat prescription of an antihypertensive drug in the 3 months
preceding the program start), participation in breast cancer screen-
ing (defined as the proportion of women with a record of referral to,
attendance at or a report from breast cancer screening or mammog-
raphy), each of the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years
and mortality for Wales in 2019 as estimated by the Global Burden of
Disease Project®, and all comorbidities (except for AIDS, which falls
under privacy-protected diagnoses not made available by the SAIL
database) that are included in the widely-used Charlson Comorbidity
Index**. Moreover, we used each of these conditions, gender, decile of
Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation®, as well as all input variables to
the Dementia Risk Score (as recorded before 1 September 2013)”, to
predict the probability (while imputing a fixed age) of anew dementia

diagnosis for each patient in the MSE-optimal bandwidthin our primary
regression discontinuity analysis for dementia. In addition to plotting
these predicted probabilities across a range of birthdates around the
2 September 1933 eligibility threshold, we also plotted the distribution
of these predicted probabilities for patients who were eligible versus
patients who were ineligible for zoster vaccination. The Read codes for
each of these variables are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
As is the case for balance tables in clinical trials, these plots provide
reassurance that individuals close to either side of the 2 September
1933 eligibility threshold are likely to be exchangeable with each other.

Second, we conducted the same analysis as we did for individuals
with birthdays on either side of the 2 September 1933 threshold also
for people with birthdays around 2 September of each of the three
years of birth preceding and succeeding 1933. For example, when
moving the start date of the program to 1 September 2011, we started
the follow-up period on 1 September 2011 and compared individuals
around the 2 September 1931 eligibility threshold. To ensure the same
length of follow-up in each of these comparisons, we had to reduce the
follow-up period to 5 years for this set of analyses. Thus, as an additional
check, we shifted the start date of the program to 1September of each
of the six years preceding (but not succeeding) 2013, which enabled
us to maintain the same seven-year follow-up period as in our primary
analysis. If another intervention that affects dementia risk also used
the 2 September threshold to define eligibility, we may then expect
to observe effects on dementia incidence for these comparisons of
individuals just around the 2 September thresholds of other birth years.

Third, we conducted the identical comparison of individuals around
the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold as in our primary analy-
sis, except for starting the follow-up period 7 years before the start of
the zoster vaccine program rollout. If there was an intervention that
used the 2 September 1933 date-of-birth eligibility threshold but was
implemented before the rollout of the zoster vaccine program, then
we may expect to see an effect of the September 1933 threshold on
dementia incidence in this analysis.

Fourth, we verified that the effects that we observed in our analyses
for dementia incidence appear to be specific to dementia. If an inter-
vention that used the exact same date-of-birth eligibility threshold
as the zoster vaccine program indeed existed, it would be unlikely to
only affect dementia risk without also having an influence on other
health outcomes. We therefore conducted the same analysis as for
when using dementia incidence as the outcome but for each of the ten
leading causes of disability-adjusted life years and mortality in Wales
in 2019 for the age group 70+ years™, as well as all conditions that are
part of the Charlson Comorbidity Index™.

Fifth, we tested for discontinuities in educational attainment at the
2 September 1933 date-of-birth threshold using data from the 2011
census in Wales”. If an educational policy had used a 2 September
(or specifically 2 September 1933) date-of-birth threshold and the
policy was effective in increasing educational attainment, we would
then expect discontinuities at the 2 September 1933 threshold in the
attained education level between eligible and ineligible individuals.
We used the identical analysis approach for this balance test as for
our primary analyses in the SAIL database, except that we computed
‘honest’ confidence intervals based on the approach by Armstrong
and Kolesar because the assignment variable (month of birth) in these
data was monthly, and therefore coarser than the assignment variable
(week of birth) in our analyses in the SAIL database*”**. This approach
guards against potential vulnerability to model misspecification and
resulting under-coverage of confidence intervals computed with more
standard methods. These honest confidence intervals are conservative
in the sense that they have good coverage properties irrespective of
whether the functional form in the regression discontinuity analysis
is misspecified, provided that the true functional form falls within
acertain class of functions. For this class, we considered a function
class defined by bounds on the second derivative of the conditional


expectation function mapping date of birth to the probability attain-
ing a certain educational level. We used conservative bounds of the
respective curvatures by relying on global estimation of higher-order
polynomials as proposed by Armstrong and Kolesar**.

Robustness to a different analytical approach. We additionally used
a difference-in-differences instrumental variable approach (DID-IV) to
confirm the findings from our regression discontinuity design because,
incontrast to the regression discontinuity analysis, this approach does
not rely on the continuity assumption (that is, the assumption that
potential confounding variables do not abruptly change at precisely
the date-of-birth eligibility threshold for the zoster vaccine program).
To doso, we restricted our sample to patients born between 1 March
1926 and 28 February 1934. This sample consists of 96,767 adults, of
whom 7,752 (8.0%) were eligible for, and 3,949 (4.1%) actually received,
zoster vaccination. We then divided our sample into yearly cohorts cen-
tred around 1 September (thatis, a cohortis all patients born between
1March of one year and 28 February of the following year). Finally, we
divided each yearly cohort into a pre-September birth season anda
post-September birth season. Using a difference-in-differences app-
roach, we then compared the outcome (new diagnoses of dementia)
between patients born in pre- and post-September birth seasons and
across yearly cohorts. More precisely, we tested whether the difference
in outcomes across birth seasons is different for the 1933/1934 cohort
than for the other cohorts. In doing so, we exploit the fact that zoster
vaccination eligibility only differs between the two birth seasons in
the 1933/1934-cohort but not in other cohorts, while accounting for
the possibility that pre-September and post-September birth seasons
may be systematically different for other reasons.

Our difference-in-differences setup implies that the interac-
tion between the post-September birth season indicator and the
1933/1934-cohort indicator constitutes an instrumental variable for
receipt of the zoster vaccine, enabling us to estimate the CACE (that
is, the effect of actually receiving the vaccine among the compliers).
This DID-IV approach relies on two important assumptions. As per the
standard exclusion restriction assumption of IV analyses, the IV com-
ponent of our DID-IV approach assumes that vaccine eligibility affects
the outcome solely through a change in actual vaccine receipt. The
DID component of our DID-IV approach assumes that, in the absence
of the vaccine eligibility rule, the between-birth-season difference in
vaccine uptake and in dementia incidence would have been the same in
the 1933/1934 cohort as in the other cohorts. To investigate the validity
of this assumption, we plotted the mean vaccine uptake and dementia
incidence with 95% Cls by birth cohorts and birth seasons (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 29). As expected, we find that the between-birth-season differ-
ences in vaccine uptake diverge only in the 1933/1934 birth cohort. The
absence of a between-birth-season difference in other birth cohorts
supports the validity of our DID assumption.

To estimate the CACE in this DID-IV framework, we used two-stage
least-squares regression. In the first stage, we identify the vaccine
uptake due to the exogeneous change in vaccination eligibility by the
following regression equation:

Vi=O+ XS XG +N, +N, * Ej (4)

where V,is a binary variable indicating patient i actually received the
zoster vaccine. S,and C, are binary variables indicating that patient i
is bornin the post-September birth season and in the 1933/1934 birth
cohort, respectively. yidentifies the vaccine uptake due to the change
ineligibility. 6, 7,,and are the constant term, birth month (January,
February, ..., December) and birth cohort (1926/1927, 1927/1928, ...,
1933/1934) fixed effect, respectively. €,is the error term.

Inthe second stage, we estimate the effect of vaccine receipt by the
following regression:

Y=atBxV, +n, +N. +6 (5)

where Y;is the outcome of patient i. V; is the probability of vaccine
receipt predicted from the first-stage regression (4). The coefficient
Bidentifies the CACE. a, 7,,and 7, are the constant term, birth month
and birth cohort (1926/1927, 1927/1928, ..., 1933/1934) fixed effect,
respectively. e;is the error term.

Robustness checks to different analytical specifications. We con-
ducted aseries of additional robustness checks. First, instead of start-
ing the follow-up period for all individuals on 1 September 2013, we
adjusted the follow-up period to account for the staggered rollout of
the program by beginning the follow-up period for each individual on
the date on which they first became eligible for the zoster vaccine (as
described in the ‘Description of the zoster vaccine rollout in Wales’ sec-
tion) (Supplementary Fig. 30). We controlled for cohort fixed effects
in these analyses to account for the one- to two-year (depending on
the year of the program) differences between cohorts in the calendar
year in which this moving follow-up windowstarted. That is, we defined
onecohort fixed effect for ineligible individuals and the first catch-up
cohort and then included additional cohort fixed effects for each group
of patients who became eligible at the same time. Second, we varied
our definition of a new diagnosis of dementia by implementing our
analysis when defining dementia as a new prescription of donepezil
hydrochloride, galantamine, rivastigmine or memantine hydrochlo-
ride. Third, we tested whether our results for the effect of being eligible
for zoster vaccination on new diagnoses of dementia, shingles and
postherpetic neuralgia hold across grace periods (that is, time periods
since the index date after which follow-up time is considered to begin
to allow for the time needed for a full immune response to develop
after vaccine administration) of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,10 and 12 months (Supple-
mentary Fig. 31). Fourth, we show our results with bandwidth choices
of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75 and 2.00 times the MSE-optimal
bandwidth (Supplementary Fig. 32). Fifth, we verified that our results
are similar when using a local second-order polynomial specification
instead of local linear regression.

Analyses to explore the effect mechanism. Changes in healthcare
pathwaysasaresult ofa shingles episode. We conducted four analy-
ses to examine this potential effect mechanism, the first three of which
are described in detail in the main text. The fourth analysis was an event
study that focused on the date ofa shingles diagnosis during the follow-
up period. Our event study compared the mean outcome in each month
relative to the month before the date of the shingles diagnosis. Our
regression model controls for changes over time (suchas due to ageing
of the study population or seasonal patterns in healthcare provider
visits) using month-level fixed effects.

To implement our event study, we restricted our study population
to those 56,098 individuals born within the MSE-optimal bandwidth
of our primary regression discontinuity analysis for dementia. We
then aggregated our event-level data into monthly longitudinal data,
spanning September 2013 to March 2022. For each outcome of inter-
est (as described in the main text), we then estimated the following
event-study regression:

FI%I=B, X ¥;*D,* shingles, + 7,+A,, (6)
ke

where Y;,is the outcome of interest for individual iin period ¢; shin-
gles is a binary variable equal to one if the individual was diagnosed
with shingles during the follow-up period; D, are indicator vari-
ables for the k months before and after the shingles diagnosis (with
k=-36, -35,...,35, 36, and set to zero for individuals who were never
diagnosed with shingles during the follow-up period); y, are the coef-
ficients of interest, which capture the difference in the outcome in
month k relative to the month before the shingles diagnosis; 7, is an
individual-level fixed effect capturing time-invariant differences across
individuals; and A,is a month-level fixed effect, capturing differences

across periods. We used standard errors that allowed for clustering at
the individual level, and therefore for autocorrelation.
Reductioninreactivations of the varicella zoster virus. We conducted
four analyses to examine this potential effect mechanism. First, we
implemented the identical regression discontinuity as in our primary
analysis, except that we included a binary variable for being diagnosed
with shingles during the follow-up period asa covariate. For the resulting
estimate to bean unbiased measure of the degree to which the effect of
zoster vaccination on dementia incidence is mediated by shingles diag-
noses, there must be no variables that are related to bothnew dementia
diagnoses and the probability of being diagnosed with shingles (thatis,
no confounding of the mediator-to-outcome relationship)”.

Second, to examine when during the follow-up period the dementia-
delaying or dementia-preventing effect of zoster vaccination begins to
emerge, we plotted Kaplan-Meier plots and (to account for compet-
ing risks) cumulative incidence curves among individuals born close
to 2 September 1933. This analysis was based on the concept of local
randomization”*”, which relies on exchangeability of individuals born
immediately before versus immediately after 2 September 1933. To
define the bandwidth for our analysis in which we could reasonably
assume exchangeability across the threshold while maximizing sta-
tistical power, we used the widest bandwidth for which we achieved
balance in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of indi-
viduals eligible versus ineligible for zoster vaccination. We evaluated
bandwidths ranging from 100% to 10% of the MSE-optimal bandwidth
(90.6 weeks) in our primary regression discontinuity analysis in 10%
decrements. The variables we used for our balance tests were the 14
variables listed in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 (except for the more
sex-specific variables of past breast cancer screening, breast cancer and
prostate cancer diagnoses) using a significance threshold of P< 0.05,
while controlling for the false-discovery rate using the Benjamini-—
Hochberg procedure”’. The largest bandwidth that achieved balance
across all variables was 54.4 weeks.

Third, to investigate whether antiviral treatment during a shingles
episode was associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia relative
to not receiving treatment during a shingles episode, we restricted
our study population to those individuals who received a diagnosis of
shingles at any time after 1January 2000 and had not received a diag-
nosis of dementia before 1 January 2000. Our exposure of interest in
this analysis was whether or not an individual received a prescription
of antiviral medication (acyclovir, famcyclovir, valacyclovir or inosine
pranobex) within three months of the first shingles diagnosis. Indi-
viduals were followed up from the date of first shingles diagnosis until
either the date of death, moving out of Wales, GP deregistration or end
of data availability (1 March 2022). We then used a multivariable Cox
proportional hazards model to regress diagnoses of dementia made
after the date of the first recorded shingles episode onto whether or
not the patient received an antiviral medication prescription for the
first shingles episode. In a robustness check, we required that anew
diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after
the date of the first shingles diagnosis. We adjusted our regressions
for gender, restricted cubic splines (with three knots) of age at the
first shingles infection, and the 12 variables in Supplementary Fig. 1
(excluding past breast and prostate cancer diagnoses).

Fourth, to explore whether experiencing recurrent shingles epi-
sodes was associated with a higher risk of dementia than having only
asingle episode, we used the same study population as in our analysis
for treated versus untreated shingles. We matched individuals (via 1:1
propensity score matching) who had more than one shingles diagnosis
(with the diagnosis dates having to be at least three months apart)
after 1January 2000 to individuals who only received a single shingles
diagnosis after 1 January 2000. We matched individuals on proximity
in the date of their first shingles diagnosis as well as the same list of
baseline variables as for our analysis of treated versus untreated shin-
gles, and forced an exact match on week of birth and gender. In each

matched pair, we used the date of the second shingles diagnosis of
the individual with more than one shingles diagnosis as the start date
of the follow-up period. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we
then regressed new diagnoses of dementia made during the follow-up
period onto whether or not the individual had received more than one
shingles diagnosis. Ina robustness check, we again required that anew
diagnosis of dementia must have been made at least 12 months after
the start date of the follow-up period.

VZV-independent immunomodulatory effect. To estimate the treat-
ment effect heterogeneities described under this section in the main
text, we fully interacted our fuzzy regression discontinuity model with
a binary variable that indicates having the condition in question (for
example, an autoimmune condition). Precisely, the fully interacted
model was specified as:

Y= at B, V+ B, x (WOB; ~ Co) + B, x Dx (WOB; ~ Co)
+B, * Vix HET; + B, x (WOB;~ Co) x HET, (7)
+B, x D;* (WOB; ~ Co) x HET; + B, x HET, + €;

where the subscript i indexes individuals. Y, is a binary variable equal
to Lif an individual was newly diagnosed with dementia during the
follow-up period. The binary variable V, indicates receipt of the zoster
vaccine. The binary variable D, indicates eligibility for the zoster vaccine
(that is, born onor after 2 September 1933). The term WOB,; ~ cy indicates
an individual's week of birth centred around the date-of-birth eligibility
threshold. The interaction term D, x (WOB; ~ Co) allows for the slope of
the regression line to differ on either side of the date-of-birth eligibil-
ity threshold. The binary variable HET; is equal to one if an individual
had the condition in question. Adding the terms (WOB,; - Co) x HET;
and D; x (WOB; ~ Co) x HET; allows the slopes to vary by this condition.

V, and V, x HET; are instrumented by D, and D; x HET;. Using the
two-stage least-squares approach, the parameter f, identifies the effect
heterogeneity, that is, the difference in CACE on the outcome between
patients with and without the condition. £, and, + B, identify the effect
among compliers in the reference and comparison group, respectively.
The estimates of the effects and heterogeneity are reported in absolute
terms. To be consistent with our primary fuzzy regression discontinuity
model (that is, without the HET; and interaction terms), we used local
linear triangular kernel regressions and the MSE-optimal bandwidth
from the primary model of the respective outcome.

For our analyses for autoimmune and allergic conditions, we used
the 19 most common autoimmune conditions as defined previously”,
and grouped the 11 least common conditions among them into a rare
conditions category. We judged those conditions to be rare that had
anincidence of less than 1% during the follow-up period in our cohort.
These rare conditions included Addison’s disease, ankylosing spondy-
litis, Coeliac disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myas-
thenia gravis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic
lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and vitiligo. For common
allergic conditions, we used those defined previously”.

Study description Quantitative quasi-experimental

Research sample For our main analysis, our study population consisted of 282,541 individuals (154,218 women and 128,322 men) born between
September 1 1925 and September 1 1942 who were registered with a primary care provider in Wales on the start date of the zoster
vaccine program rollout (September 1 2013) and had no dementia diagnosis prior to the program rollout. The rationale for using a
sample that is centered, in terms of birth dates, around the eligibility cutoff, is to maximize the sample size in each treatment group.
The mean age at program start (September 1 2013) was 77.88 years old and the sample is representative for the Welsh population
born between September 1 1925 and September 1 1942.

Sampling strategy Due to the quasi-experimental/retrospective analysis strategy of routine patient data, "sampling procedure" is not an applicable
category. There was no sampling, as the SAIL databank covers all registered individuals meeting our inclusion criteria and hence our
data are representative for the described population.

Since there was no sampling and key parameters (e.g. compliance with the threshold, distribution of dementia measures at the
threshold) were unknown a priori and the prospective sample size was unlikely to significantly limit the precision of the analysis, we
refrained from doing a formal sample size calculation

Data collection The manuscript did not rely on primary data collection. The researchers were not blinded to the experimental condition and/or the
study hypothesis.

Timing Our retrospective analysis relies on data recorded by the NHS between 2000 and 2023

Data exclusions We pre-defined our retrospective research sample as adult patients, born between September 1 1925 and September 1 1942 who
were registered with a primary care provider in Wales on the start date of the zoster vaccine program rollout. For the analysis of the
effect on the first diagnosis of dementia, we excluded patients who already were diagnosed with dementia by September 2013, as
these patients, by design, cannot experience a first diagnosis of dementia anymore. This led to the exclusion of 13,783 patients.
Additionally we excluded 279 people born in the week starting on August 28 1933. Since we observe birth dates only at a weekly
level, we cannot say whether these 279 people were eligible to receive the vaccine or not. We did not exclude any patients because


of other criteria or metrics.

Non-participation Due to the quasi-experimental/retrospective analysis strategy of routine patient data, "non-participation" is not an applicable
category.
Randomization There is no active randomization in the quasi-experimental analysis that we used for this manuscript (regression discontinuity

analysis). Confounding is discussed and studied extensively throughout the manuscript. The arbitrary nature of the eligibility rule
implies that there cannot be any self-selection or intentional sorting and thus that patients just below and above the threshold are
close to identical in their underlying and unobserved characteristics. We demonstrated that there is no distinct discontinuity in any
relevant baseline measures for measures of health, frequency of GP visits, and dementia diagnosis themselves, signifying that these
variables do not confound our analysis. We demonstrate this further using balance tests, empirically showing that a comprehensive
set of potential confounding variables, including demographic characteristics, physiological variables, and markers of healthcare
utilization are all continuously distributed across the threshold. Taken together, our analyses provide strong evidence that the
necessary assumptions for a valid regression discontinuity analysis were met, meaning that patients below and above the threshold
were comparable in observable as well as unobservable characteristics.
