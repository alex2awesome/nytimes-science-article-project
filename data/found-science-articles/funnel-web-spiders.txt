Pessman and Hebets show that the
funnel-weaving spider’s past and current

noise, rural webs retained energy in

webs attenuated short-range vibrations.
This flexibility may enhance information

SUMMARY

Animals rely on the reception of accurate information for survival and reproduction. Environmental noise,
especially from human activity, challenges information acquisition by disturbing sensory channels and mask-
ing relevant cues. Investigations into how animals cope with noise have been heavily biased toward plasticity
in information production, often overlooking flexibility in information reception. Studying internal sensory
structures is challenging, but web-building spiders offer a unique opportunity to investigate external sensory
surfaces—their webs. Here, we explored the potential of the funnel-weaving spider, Agelenopsis pennsylvan-
ica, to influence information reception amid vibratory noise. During web construction, we exposed spiders to
a 2 X 2 fully-crossed design: rural/urban collection sites and quiet/loud noise treatments, reflecting natural
vibratory noise variation. On the resulting webs, we compared frequency-dependent energy loss between
site/treatment groups as vibrations transmitted short and longer distances from an artificial stimulus to
the spider’s hunting position. Under loud vibratory noise, rural webs retained more energy in longer-distance
vibratory stimuli across a narrow frequency range (350-600 Hz) than all other groups, potentially to improve
the reception of relevant prey and mate cues. Conversely, urban/loud webs lost more energy in short-dis-
tance vibrations across a broader frequency range (300-1,000 Hz) than all other groups, likely to prevent sen-
sory overload from constant, high-amplitude urban noise. Variable web transmission was related to spiders’
prior (ancestral and/or developmental) and current noise exposure. Our study highlights the capacity of an-
imals to influence information reception amid environmental noise and emphasizes the importance of a ho-
listic approach to studying information flow in dynamic environments.

INTRODUCTION animals adopt to mitigate the detrimental effects of environ-
mental noise.

Compared with predator-prey interactions, our understanding
of animal communication in noise has a stronger conceptual
framework, so we draw on this literature for examples. When
noise drowns out signals and/or overlaps spectrally, animals
may adjust signal timing or structure to improve the signal-to-

The accurate reception of information— whether about the pres-
ence of predators, prey, potential mates, or the environment—is
critical for animals to make informed behavioral decisions." It is
not surprising, then, that numerous studies across disparate
taxa provide a strong foundation of understanding (both ultimate

and proximate) regarding the transmission and reception of in-
formation.” “ Whether in the context of communication? or pred-
ator-prey interactions,°’ information serves to reduce a re-
ceiver’s uncertainty about the source’s identity, condition,
location, or intention, among others. Yet, environmental noise
can interfere with effective information flow by distorting or
masking signals or cues.*°

Although natural noise has shaped animal behavior
throughout evolutionary history,'° surges in human activity
since the Industrial Revolution have introduced novel noise. In
addition to being more intense and persistent than natural sour-
ces,'' anthropogenic sources (e.g., traffic, industrial equip-
ment, etc.) overlap spectrally with biologically relevant fre-
quencies.® The emergence of these novel noise landscapes
has incited a recent push to investigate the diverse strategies

noise ratio. For instance, some birds delay their dawn chorus un-
til there is a reduction in aircraft noise'* or insect choruses, '°
treehoppers pause signaling during periods of high wind noise, '“
brown tree frogs increase the pitch of their songs to avoid over-
lapping with traffic noise frequencies,'° and Australian lizards
switch from continuous to intermittent tail flicking in windy con-
ditions to improve signal visibility against a noisy visual back-
ground.'° These examples emphasize the importance of identi-
fying biologically relevant noise frequencies and_ highlight
ways in which animals can preserve signal efficacy in noisy
environments. '”

Despite research focusing on how signalers enhance the pro-
duction and transmission of information amid noise, the funda-
mental question of how animals detect and discriminate informa-
tion remains understudied.°"'® This research gap means that we

know little about the putative flexibility of animal sensory sys-
tems'° and likely stems from the challenges of studying sensory
systems in naturally behaving animals.2° Nonetheless, identi-
fying how noise impacts the reception of information and how
animals might overcome it is crucial to understanding the full
impact of anthropogenic noise on animal interactions and
survival.

This study explores the potential for animals to influence their
reception of relevant information in the presence of noise. To do
this, we focus on spiders and their webs—an external structure
that functions as an extension of the spider’s internal sensory
processing. With over 100 million years of evolution,”' spider
webs are highly specialized sensory devices whose vibration
transmission enables these architects to detect and capture
prey, identify and assess mates, and sense and evade preda-
tors.°?-°* Despite proposed hypotheses that spiders can manip-
ulate how vibrations propagate across their webs by adjusting
silk properties, web geometry, and active tensioning,°° webs
have never been tested for their propensity to variably regulate
vibration transmission. Here, we explore this capacity with
respect to environmental vibratory noise.

The funnel-weaving spider (or grass spider), Agelenopsis
pennsylvanica,*° constructs funnel-shaped webs (Figure 1B)
that lack sticky silk,°’ leaving spiders to rely on vibratory cues
(e.g., frequency, attenuation, and direction) and their own speed
to detect, locate, assess, and capture prey before escape.**
Vibratory information (from prey, predators, mates, etc.) is intro-
duced onto the web sheet and travels across its surface to the
narrow, tubular part of the web funnel (hereafter, the retreat),
where the spider resides and monitors the web for vibratory in-
formation (Figure 1B). These spiders are found across urban-ru-
ral gradients,*°-° likely across the genus’ North American range.
Urban areas, where these spiders are especially abundant,”°

exhibit daily vibratory noise levels that can reach up to 22 dB
higher than rural areas.”° The frequency bandwidth of this envi-
ronmental noise also overlaps with biologically relevant fre-
quency ranges (<1 kHz),”° and the webs of A. pennsylvanica
are inextricably connected with surfaces (e.g., bushes, trees,
grass, rocks, and buildings) that propagate vibrations from
noise-producing sources, such as traffic and harvesting equip-
ment. Consequently, vibratory noise likely interferes with the
ability of A. pennsylvanica to acquire critical vibratory information
from their webs.°°

Prior research documenting biologically relevant environ-
mental noise for A. pennsylvanica®® led us to propose the
following questions. (1) What range of frequencies within known
environmental noise is relevant to A. pennsylvanica foraging? (2)
Do vibrations travel differently across webs built by rural and ur-
ban spiders under different vibratory noise treatments? If vibra-
tory noise disrupts the accurate reception of vibratory informa-
tion, then spiders may influence how information travels across
the web to mitigate the effects of noise. This investigation of a
spider’s web as an external sensory structure represents a
gateway to assessing the internal mechanisms of information
reception and its flexibility in environmental noise.

RESULTS

Spiders’ responses to pure tone frequencies

To determine what range of frequencies within known environ-
mental noise are relevant to A. pennsylvanica foraging, we as-
sessed attack rates of rural and urban spiders to artificial fre-
quency stimuli that overlap with field-recorded vibratory noise
(<1 kHz). Under ambient laboratory conditions, we rested a linear
resonant actuator (LRA) on webs built by spiders collected from
rural (n = 95) and urban (n = 94) environments and provided pure

Figure 2. Results from spider responses to pure tone frequencies
We tested the proportion of spiders that attacked within the frequency range
of field-recorded vibratory noise (<1 kHz). We used a binomial generalized
additive model to test variation in the probability of rural and urban
A. pennsylvanica attacking pure tone frequencies from 100 to 1,000 Hz in
100-Hz increments. The points and error ribbon represents the proportion of
spiders that attacked at each frequency and the 95% confidence interval from
the model. Some spiders had prior playback experience (see Table Si), but
this was dropped from the model as it did not significantly affect model fit.
Rural and urban spiders attacked all frequencies with approximately equal
probability. When we controlled for habitation by testing only responses to the
first frequency, we found similar results (see Figure S1).

tone vibrations between 100 and 1,000 Hz in 100-Hz increments
and in random order, ensuring that all frequencies vibrated at the
same amplitude (Figures 1C and 1D). We observed whether spi-
ders (not fed within the 24 h before trial) attacked the LRA during
each 15-s tone, separated by 60 s of silence. For the analysis, we
only included spiders that attacked at least one of the ten fre-
quencies (rural = 58 out of 95, urban = 63 out of 94). Future
research exploring potential differences in sensory capabilities,
motivation, or boldness (among others) is necessary to under-
stand why 36% of tested spiders did not respond. Collection
sites (R1, R2, U1, and U2, Figure 1A), years (2022 and 2023),
participation in previous experiments (i.e., microhabitat use or
web construction under playback; see Table S1), and age were
all dropped from the binomial generalized additive model as
random effects, as their inclusion did not significantly improve
model fit. The final model included frequency as a smoothed
term varying by rural/urban. Although this model explained little
of the variance (R? = 0.009), the inclusion of the smoothed term
significantly improved the model fit compared with the (null)
model with rural/urban removed (F = 2.578, p = 0.015, 4AIC =
6.124). This suggests that the shape of the relationship between
frequency and attack likelihood might differ between rural and
urban spiders.

However, rural (Figure 2, edf = 3.012, X? = 8.422, p =0.072) and
urban (Figure 2, edf = 2.545, X? = 3.744, p = 0.202) spiders at-
tacked all frequencies (100-1,000 Hz) with approximately equal
probability, suggesting that spiders do not rely on a specific vibra-
tory frequency range for prey detection but instead attack broadly
across the range of noise. When we controlled for habituation (see
Figure S1A) by testing only responses to the first frequency, we

found similar results (Figure S1B; rural: edf = 1.236, xX? = 0.127,
p = 0.911; urban: edf = 1.956, X* = 3.693, p = 0.208). Rural and
urban spiders did not differ in average attack likelihood (Figure 2,
df = 1204, T-ratio = 0.505, p = 0.6133).

Noise effects on web vibration transmission

To test whether vibrations travel differently across webs built by ru-
ral and urban spiders under different vibratory noise treatments,
we exposed rural and urban adult female A. pennsylvanica to quiet
or loud vibratory noise playback for 4 days, during which they built
new webs. We provided white-noise (<1 kHz) vibrations that
differed in amplitude (signal-to-noise ratio 0-1,000 Hz; quiet =
4.20 + 0.23 dB, loud = 31.96 + 0.32 dB) similar to differences re-
corded in the field (~22 dB daily average range).”° Our artificial vi-
brations were coupled to the web-building substrate (Figure S2)
using a custom-built arena connected to a subwoofer (Figure 3A).
After 4 days of noise exposure, we removed the arena from the
subwoofer and measured vibratory energy loss (or attenuation/
damping) through transmission across the newly constructed
web (Figures 3B-3D). We introduced vibrations to the web sheet
(Figure 1B) via an artificial vibration stimulus (white noise < 2 kHz
from a mini shaker) and measured resultant vibrations with a laser
vibrometer at the spider’s typical foraging position (the “retreat”, or
narrow, tubular web section, see Figure 1B). We measured trans-
verse wave transmission because prey impact is typically perpen-
dicular to the web plane.°° Our spider groups (rural/quiet, rural/
loud, urban/quiet, and urban/loud) did not differ in days since
maturation (F356 = 0.425, p = 0.736) or body condition (Fa.s6 =
0.551, p = 0.650). We tested 15 webs built by separate spiders
(each constructing a single web) for each unique rural/urban,
quiet/loud combination (i.e., a total of 60 independent webs).
Short-distance vibration transmission

To measure how vibrations produced close to a foraging spider
transmit, we applied the vibration stimulus at three different po-
sitions 3.5 cm from the opening of the web retreat, where the spi-
der forages (Figure 1B, the position of all recordings). We ran
three trials at each of the three positions and averaged across tri-
als and positions (transmission was similar between positions;
Figure S4). The generalized additive model testing the variation
in energy loss across frequencies by the unique site/treatment
groups (rural/quiet, rural/loud, urban/quiet, and urban/loud) ex-
plained much of the variance (R? = 0.748) and was a significantly
better fit than the (null) model with the groups removed (F = 1665,
p < 0.001, 4AIC = 29,930.8). These results suggest that the
shape of the relationship between frequency and energy loss dif-
fers between site/treatment groups.

To test for site/treatment-specific variation in vibratory stim-
ulus energy loss, we explored patterns of energy loss in two
distinct frequency ranges: (1) below 1,000 Hz (overlapping
known noise frequencies) and (2) above 1,000 Hz (outside the
range of known noise). Differences among all site/treatment
groups were assessed through pairwise comparisons. Signifi-
cant differences were further examined for non-overlapping
95% confidence intervals, allowing us to evaluate how each
group compared with others within these frequency ranges (Ta-
ble 1; Figure 4A). Below 1,000 Hz, transmission of webs built by
urban, but not rural, spiders differed by the treatment conditions
(quiet versus loud web construction) (Table 1; Figure 4A). For
short-distance vibrations, urban/loud webs lost more energy,

controlled white-noise vibrations produced by a
mini shaker (yellow, stimulus) elsewhere on the
web.

(C) Although the laser vibrometer recorded from
the same position on each web, we provided the
stimulus at six positions on the web: three short
distances from the stimulus to the retreat and
three longer distances.

(D) The shaker produced vibrations adjusted to
have equal vibration amplitudes from 0.5 to
2,000 Hz. The graph represents the amplitude (as

energy lost as the vibrations traveled from the

tions). The raw data are shown along with the line

or attenuated/damped, between about 300 and 1,000 Hz
compared with other webs (see urban/loud; Table 1; Figure 4A).
This increased energy loss close to the foraging position may
unction to decrease the perception of environmental noise in
this frequency range. Urban/quiet webs also damped vibrations
in comparison with any rural web, particularly in the range of
300-600 Hz (Table 1). Above 1,000 Hz, short-range web vibra-
tions only differed between urban/loud and rural/quiet—urban/
loud were damped compared with rural/quiet (Table 1;
Figure 4A).

Longer-distance vibration transmission

We also applied vibratory stimuli at three different positions 7 cm
rom the opening of the web retreat (Figure 1B). Again, the gener-
alized additive model assessing attenuation across frequencies
ior the site/treatment groups explained a considerable amount
of the variance (R? = 0.753) and was a better fit than the (null)
model with the groups removed (F = 1656.9, p < 0.001, AAIC =
29,500.7). Above 1,000 Hz, webs built by urban/loud spiders
were damped in comparison with any rural web (Table 1; Fig-
ure 4B). At longer transmission distances, below 1,000 Hz, urban
spider webs transmitted vibrations similarly between treatments
(Table 1; Figure 4B), in contrast to their previously described
apparent damping of 300-1,000Hz short-range vibrations.

Frequency (Hz)

Rural/loud webs, however, retained more
energy, or amplified, in vibrations between
about 350 and 600 Hz compared with
webs built by all other groups (see rural/loud; Table 1; Figure 4B).
Within each site/treatment group, we also found that longer-dis-
tance vibrations lost more energy than short-distance vibrations
across the entire measured frequency spectrum (Figure S5).
Following vibration transmission tests, for each web we re-
corded the wet mass of the total silk used and the dry mass
following 48 h in a 50°C drying oven. Neither rural/urban, the
noise treatment, nor their interaction significantly predicted the
dry silk mass used per spider body mass, nor did rural/urban
predict the percent silk moisture (Figure S6). However, there
was a non-significant trend wherein webs built under loud condi-
tions had higher moisture in their silk than webs built under quiet
conditions, but this was driven primarily by an increase in silk
moisture for rural/loud versus rural/quiet webs (Figure S6B).

DISCUSSION

Our study provides evidence of significant flexibility in information
acquisition from an external sensory structure—spider webs—in
response to environmental noise: flexibility that is dependent on
the spider’s collection location (rural/urban). We have shown pre-
viously that natural vibratory noise predominantly occurs at fre-
quencies below 1,000 Hz for A. pennsyivanica,°° which may

pose a significant challenge to the reception of cues or signals
produced by prey and mates. In this study, we first demonstrate
that A. pennsylvanica exhibits predatory behavior across the
entire spectrum of natural vibratory noise frequencies, confirming
the relevance of this frequency range for their sensory ecology.
Next, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that the spider’s
exposure to environmental noise—both previous/ancestral expo-
sure to noise in their natural habitat (rural versus urban) and their
recent experience with noise during web construction (quiet
versus loud playbacks)—influences how vibration frequencies
transmit across their web’s surface. When constructed under
loud conditions, webs of rural and urban spiders exhibited distinct
differences in web vibration transmission in three key ways: (1) the
breadth of the frequency range modified (narrow in rural/broad in
urban), (2) whether energy was retained (rural) or lost (urban), and
(3) the transmission distance affected (short in urban/longer in ru-
ral). Rural/loud webs retained more energy (amplified) in a narrow
frequency range (350-600 Hz) compared with all other groups
(rural/quiet, urban/quiet, and urban/loud) during /onger-distance
transmission. On the other hand, urban/loud webs /ost more en-
ergy (attenuated and/or damped) in a broad frequency range

(300-1,000 Hz) compared with all other site/treatment groups
when vibration stimuli were produced closer to the retreat. Inter-
estingly, the frequency ranges of modified transmission aligned
with the simulated noise frequencies produced by our experi-
mental playback (Figure S2). These contrasting patterns between
rural/loud and urban/loud treatments may help spiders balance
prey detection and manage environmental noise, and _ this
balancing act is dependent on the spider's collection site (rural/
urban). Notably, it is also possible that rural/urban spiders are
genetically distinct, in which case different responses to noise
may not reflect developmental experience per se but may be
genetically linked. Regardless of the reasons for the differences
(developmental experience or genetic differences), the webs built
by rural versus urban spiders under loud conditions showed clear
distinctions in their transmission properties.

Environmental noise can mask vital sensory information when
both overlap in the same spectral frequencies. Because natural
vibratory noise in the habitats of A. pennsylvanica occurs below
1,000 Hz,”° we tested the predatory responses of rural and urban
spiders within this range. Both groups broadly responded to
pure tone vibrations across frequencies that align with vibrations

Figure 4. Results from the web vibration transmission experiment

We showed how vibrations propagated across the web’s surface from the
stimulus to the web retreat over (A) short distances and (B) longer distances.
We measured the energy loss, or attenuation, of stimulus vibrations
(<2,000 Hz) as they traveled across webs of rural and urban spiders con-
structed for four nights under quiet or loud vibratory noise treatments (15 webs
each). Background lines are the calculated means across webs for each
group, whereas lines and error ribbons show generalized additive model
predictions with 95% confidence intervals. For each web, we averaged across
trials and stimulus positions (see Figure S3 for calculations) for each trans-
mission distance (9 trials each) because transmission was similar across po-
sitions (Figure S4). The dashed line at 1,000 Hz separates frequencies over-
lapping with field-recorded and playback treatment vibratory noise (<1 kHz)
from those outside it (>1 kHz). We performed pairwise comparisons of the site/
treatment groups using the estimated marginal means of energy loss below
and above 1 kHz (Table 1) and then used non-overlapping 95% confidence

produced by a struggling juvenile cricket (~250-700 Hz, per-
sonal observation) and prey more generally.°'°* Thus, elevated
noise levels within this frequency range are likely to mask impor-
tant information. Given the temporal and spatial variability of ru-
ral and urban noise levels,7° spiders in more variable habitats
may generalize their attention to a wider frequency range to
cope with challenges from information masking. Our findings
of frequency-independent attacks support the idea that variable
noise conditions may favor generalized responses to vibratory
information, conforming to prior studies of other animals that
demonstrate generalist strategies that allow foragers to be flex-
ible in rapidly changing conditions,*° particularly in urban areas
(e.g., in moths” and in birds®’). Finally, the frequencies that initi-
ated attacks in our first experiment coincided with frequency-
specific modifications of rural/urban web vibration transmission
under loud noise, suggesting a predatory advantage of
enhancing salient cues amid environmental noise. We note that
there were limited differences in energy loss outside the range
of noise (>1,000 Hz, Figure 4; Table 1).

In general, signals and cues produced further (versus closer)
from the foraging spider are more likely to be masked by noise
because vibratory information loses more energy as transmis-
sion distance increases. Despite this, vibrations that traveled
longer distances on rural/loud webs arrived at the spider’s
foraging retreat with more energy in a narrow, but extremely rele-
vant, frequency range than other site/treatment groups at this
distance, effectively amplifying and retaining high transmission
efficacy of the pertinent information. This frequency-specific
change to the transmission of vibratory stimuli presumably in-
creases the spider’s capacity for detecting relevant signals/
cues under noisy conditions. Similar tuning has been demon-
strated in the internal sensory systems of spiders, as electro-
physiological recordings from an important vibration receptor
on spider legs (the metatarsal lyriform organ) have exhibited
heightened sensitivities to frequencies consistent with prey vi-
brations (increasing sensitivity up to 1,000 Hz)*° and potentially
to predator cues (up to 5,000 Hz).°’ Our results support the
idea that webs act as extensions of the spider’s sensory sys-
tem®® and can be adaptatively tuned.

If the narrow range of energy retention observed in rural/loud
webs is highly relevant for prey capture, one might ask why we
did not see more attacks of rural spiders to this frequency range.
Though there was a trend in this direction (Figure 2), there was
also more than 30% of spiders that did not attack. It is likely
that additional cues (e.g., visual) may be important in initiating at-
tacks, and future work should explore attack probabilities of nat-
ural prey at higher resolution to get a finer-scale understanding of
the relationship between vibratory cues and attack probabilities.
Finally, we note that vibratory conspecific communication also

intervals to determine the specific frequency ranges where site/treatment pairs
differed. Above 1,000 Hz, only urban/loud webs exhibited damping compared
with rural webs (only rural/quiet at short range). (A) Short-distance vibrations
on urban/loud webs lost more energy (attenuated/damped) across a broad
frequency range (300-1,000 Hz) compared with all other groups. (B) Rural
webs constructed under loud noise retained more energy (amplified) in longer-
distance vibrations in a narrow frequency range (350-600 Hz) compared with
all other groups. Longer-distance vibrations always lost more energy than
short-distance vibrations (Figure S5).

occurs during courtship (~100-600 Hz, personal observation),
raising the possibility that manipulations of web vibratory trans-
mission may function in more than just prey detection and
foraging.

Unlike rural environments that have lower and less-predictable
noise levels, spiders in urban environments experience chronic
exposure to heightened levels of vibratory noise.?°°° Such
persistent, louder noise could lead to sensitivity impairments
over time. Age-related hearing loss has only recently been exam-
ined for arthropods, “°"' and noise-related hearing loss has only
been explored in the tympanal ear of the desert locust.“? We hy-
pothesize that long-term exposure to noise might negatively
impact arthropod hearing and that urban spiders use their
webs to mitigate environmental sensory overload by reducing
broad-band noise. Support for this hypothesis is evidenced by
the dramatic and broad reduction in energy transmitted (and
thus, signal-to-noise ratio), specifically within the documented
range of urban noise across urban webs built under loud condi-
tions. In further support, noise-dependent web damping only
occurred for vibrations produced near the spider’s retreat, sug-
gesting that the urban spider produced a buffer zone immedi-
ately around its foraging position. Although a close buffer zone
may reduce persistent broad-band noise, it may simultaneously
reduce the signal-to-noise ratio, making it more challenging for
urban spiders to react to prey at close distances. Future foraging
studies can explore such potential sensory trade-offs as well as
putative foraging strategies to overcome them (e.g., urban spi-
ders may focus foraging reactions on longer-distance stimuli).

Although we did not observe the same vibratory damping
(300-1 ,000 Hz) in longer-distance vibrations as seen in short-dis-
tance, longer-distance vibrations in urban/loud webs did show
greater energy loss than short-distance vibrations. We suspect
that distinct transmission properties across different regions of
a single web—i.e., near the retreat versus at the edges— may ac-
count for discrepancies across distances. In addition, the
observed damping of vibrations between 300 and 1,000 Hz
near the retreat of urban/loud webs may serve to reduce vibra-
tions from airborne noise introduced near the foraging spider.
Although vibratory noise is likely introduced to the web via the
anchor points connecting it to the substrate, airborne noise
can also transfer vibrations directly to any part of the web.*°
Our playback treatments during web construction produced
different levels of airborne noise (quiet = 56.78 + 1.40 dB,
loud = 67.80 + 1.06 dB) that resembled natural levels in rural
and urban habitats (60.7-74.3 dB).“* Additional studies exploring
spatial patterns of frequency transmission paired with behavioral
studies are now needed to assess where and how transmission
differences translate into foraging (or mating) efficiency, as wel
as how airborne and substrate-borne noise interact and propa-
gate as vibrations on the web.

We also acknowledge that interpreting the biological signifi-
cance of our artificial stimulus is challenging, as the introduced
vibrations could be viewed either as noise traveling through the
web or as relevant signals and cues. The difficulty arises
because observed energy loss could reflect a reduction in both
noise and relevant signals, whereas, ideally, webs would func-
tion to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, characterized by noise
reduction and signal amplification. Future empirical playback
studies and theoretical models should test how noise and

relevant signals/cues interact as they transmit simultaneously
across webs with different transmission properties.

The extent to which previous experience with noise shapes
real-time plastic behavioral responses is understudied, particu-
larly in arthropods. Evidence from Lampe et al.“° suggests a role
for developmental plasticity in response to noise, as grasshoppers
exhibited adjustments to adult signal frequency (Hz) based on
noise exposure during development. Further, there is likely acom-
plex interplay between previous experience with noise and plastic
responses to current noise conditions“° because variable noise
environments tend to persist into adulthood. In our study, we
could not distinguish between developmental plasticity, maternal
effects, and/or genetic differentiation as underlying the observed
differences between rural and urban spiders. Although gene
flow between rural and urban populations is likely due to the
ballooning dispersal mode“’ of A. pennsylvanica (personal obser-
vation), genetic differentiation or maternal effects may still be at
play. To further elucidate these potential mechanisms, future
research should rear F2 generations of rural and urban spiders
in quiet or loud vibratory treatments.

We identified potential material or structural differences that
may underlie the differential propagation of vibratory informa-
tion, though further investigation is necessary to explore these
and other mechanisms in detail. Variations in silk stiffness
(modulus) and tension (pre-stress) affect the amplitude- and fre-
quency-filtering capacities of webs.°°“° Factors such as the silk
length,*° connectivity of strands,°' mesh size,°° and number of
attachments with the substrate°’ contribute to the web’s struc-
ture and distinct vibratory transmission properties. For example,
Gomes et al. found a correlation between Larinioides patagiatus
web structure and environmental noise in the field, but suggest
that prey abundance may mediate this effect.°* However, a pre-
vious laboratory study on Araneus diadematus found no adjust-
ments to web geometry when anchor points were attached to
moving substrates,*° suggesting that this ability may be spe-
cies-specific or that the silk properties, rather than web geome-
try, may potentially drive web transmission differences. Although
we found no differences in dry silk mass (Figure S6A), webs con-
structed under loud conditions showed a trend toward higher silk
moisture than those built under quiet conditions (Figure S6B),
though this was largely driven by increased silk moisture for ru-
ral/loud versus rural/quiet webs. This may suggest a potential
role of supercontraction—a unique property of spider silk where
added moisture leads silk to shrink up to 50%,°°—though
whether spiders have control over silk supercontraction is un-
known. Anecdotally, we also observed that webs built under
loud conditions often had larger anchor points (i.e., places where
the web attached to the substrate; Figure S7), which appeared to
more strongly resist detachment during silk collection. Although
quantifying these anchor point characteristics was not feasible
for the present study, we hypothesize that thicker, stronger an-
chor points may damp substrate-borne noise before it is intro-
duced to the web’s surface by influencing the web’s geometry
or silk properties, such as tension and stiffness. Future experi-
ments are necessary to directly assess the functional signifi-
cance of these observed differences in anchor points.

This study has unveiled the extraordinary potential of web-
building spiders to create a structure, the web, which can alter
the spider’s perception of information when environmental noise


Current Biology

is present. Our findings demonstrate that the web functions as a
pre-processer or filter of information before perception by the
spider. Our results provide empirical support for Miller and Mor-
timer’s hypothesis’ that spiders exhibit morphological compu-
tation by manipulating the vibratory environment of their webs
to preemptively mitigate the effects of noise before information
reaches the central nervous system (CNS). If webs can pre-pro-
cess information, they may alleviate the processing demands
when noise masks or overwhelms the system.°° For a complete
understanding of how animals may, or may not, cope with envi-
ronmental noise, we must include how information is received
and processed, an angle that is too often overlooked. The accu-
rate reception of information is necessary for survival and repro-
duction, facilitating precise identification, evaluation, and locali-
zation of prey, threats, and mates. To date, only a few systems
have been explored with respect to how animals might manipu-
late their sensory environment for increased information acquisi-
tion. The ground burrows of Eupsophus frogs can amplify
incoming (in addition to outgoing) signals and cues from other
frogs and nocturnal owls; however, it is unclear whether these
amplifications are intentional or a by-product of using the burrow
as a refuge.°° Similarly, cavity-nesting black-capped chickadees
excavate tree-cavity nests in the direction of extra-pair partners
to improve signal detection during the dawn chorus.”

We unveil the first evidence that a spider that relies on its self-
made web for vibratory information acquisition can control its vi-
bration transmission in response to differing levels of vibratory
noise. The plastic changes in this extended phenotype highlight
inter-individual variation in the receiver's ability to cope with bio-
logically relevant noise. Moreover, a history of noise exposure,
either during development or across generations, appears to
further influence noise-related web modifications. With the rise
of intense and rapid changes to animals’ sensory landscapes
brought on by anthropogenic noise, we advocate for future
research to adopt a more holistic approach that is inclusive of in-
formation reception, hidden sensory channels like the vibratory
channel, and previous exposure. We anticipate that this research
will open doors for further investigation into the flexibility of re-
ceivers’ sensory systems.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS

We collected data for these experiments across two years: 2022 and 2023. In 2022, we collected 129 juvenile female Agelenopsis
pennsylvanica in their penultimate instar from four sites — two rural (Figure 1A; 32 from R1 and 33 from R2) and two urban (Figure 1A;
39 from U1 and 25 from U2) August 4-10. In 2023, we collected 60 juvenile female A. pennsylvanica in their penultimate instar from one
rural and one urban site (80 each, R1 and U1) August 1-3. In both years, we housed spiders individually in 8.3 x 8.3 x 8.3 cm opaque
containers suspended over a tub of water with chicken wire mesh to receive ad libitum water through a cotton wick provided through
a hole in the bottom of the container. We fed the spiders two 1/8-inch crickets twice a week and checked for molts every other day.
The room maintained a temperature of 25°C with a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle starting at 07:00. Spiders matured between mid-
August and early-September.

METHOD DETAILS

Spiders’ Responses to Pure Tone Frequencies
To determine what range of frequencies within known environmental noise (< 1 kHz)°” are relevant to A. pennsylvanica foraging, we
measured spiders’ responses to pure tone frequencies below 1000 Hz. We used a 10-mm Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA) to deliver
pure tone vibrations onto each web through contact with the web’s surface (Figure 1C). We produced pure tone frequencies in Au-
dacity® (v. 3.4.0) for 100 to 1000 Hz in 100 Hz increments. When generating the tones, we set the amplitude (with options 0 for silence
to 1 for maximum amplitude without clipping) for each frequency to 0.5 except for 100 Hz, which we set with an amplitude of 1. We did
this because 100 Hz vibrated at quieter amplitudes than the other frequencies as measured by a Polytec Portable Digital Vibrometer
(Model 100), and we wanted all frequencies to vibrate at the same amplitude. To calibrate the relative amplitudes of the input (vibr-
ometer) and output (LRA) through our audio interface (MixPre-6), we calibrated the interface input gain (20 dB with an output volume
of 90) using an analog oscilloscope (Hameg Instruments, Model: HM303-6) and determined a particle velocity of 1.5 mm/s at 500 Hz
following the methods of Michael et al.°° We did not filter the playback because the peak frequencies from these tests matched the
intended frequencies.

We produced ten playback files where the 15-second pure tone frequencies were in a different random order in each file and sepa-
rated by 60 seconds of silence (Figure 1D). We randomly selected from 10 uniquely ordered playback files for each spider but ensured

e1 Current Biology 35, 1706-1715.e1-e4, April 21, 2025

Current Biology ©@ CellPress

equal distribution of the ten files between groups. Each of the 10 playback files began with a unique frequency of the 10 possible
frequencies, allowing us to perform an additional test of the responses to only the first frequency to control for habituation (see Fig-
ure S1). As spiders typically built and rested in a retreat in a corner of the square container, we lowered the LRA to just touch the web
surface between the center of the web and the opposite corner of the container, about 7 cm from the spider. The same observer ran
all trials to ensure equal forces were applied to each web at the point of contact with the LRA. We observed whether each spider
attacked the LRA (defined as making contact with the LRA) within the time that the pure tone played on the web. For analysis, we
included only the spiders that attacked at least one of the ten pure tone frequencies, which brought our sample size to 45 rural spiders
in 2022 (out of 65), 41 urban spiders in 2022 (out of 64), 13 rural spiders in 2023 (out of 30), and 22 urban spiders in 2023 (out of 30).
Many spiders participated in these trials after participating in an additional playback study (see Table S1 about participation in pre-
vious experiments). The observer was blind to the spider’s collection site and any previous participation in experiments (Table S1).

Noise Effects on Web Vibration Transmission

We wanted to test whether vibrations travel differently across webs built by rural and urban A. pennsylvanica under distinct vibratory
noise treatments. We used the 60 female A. pennsylvanica spiders collected in 2023 and conducted this experiment before testing
their response to different pure tone frequencies described above.

Vibratory Playback Treatments During Four Nights of Web Construction
We randomly assigned adult rural and urban spiders to construct webs under one of two vibratory playback treatments: quiet or loud.
To provide a controlled vibratory environment, we crafted an arena (Figure 3A) using an 8-inch diameter subwoofer (Skar Audio,
Model: FSX8-8) with the cone removed to eliminate disturbance in the near-field. ’° We connected an 8-inch diameter embroidering
loop to the speaker using a wooden skewer scaffold, secured by mounting putty and hot glue (Figure 3A). To provide a substrate for
the spider to construct its web and allow an observer to easily view and photograph the web, we cut black photography velvet to fit
tightly in the embroidering loop. Arenas were housed in 18-gallon plastic, opaque storage bins with holes cut in the lid for light to enter
and to reduce visual and acoustic disturbance. The tubs also rested on acoustic foam to reduce vibratory disturbances. We con-
nected the speaker to a four-channel stereo microamp (Behringer, Model HA400) with a custom double alligator clip-to-3.5 mm ste-
reo cable (Figure 3A). The microamp was connected to a digital recorder (Tascam TEAC Corporation, Model DR-05X) which played
low-frequency white noise as vibrations through the speaker. We built six arenas in total to simultaneously run six trials at a time.
For the vibratory playback file, we created the white noise in Audacity” (v. 3.4.0) using a low pass filter with a cutoff of 1000 Hz and
a6 dB per octave roll-off to mimic ambient vibratory noise in the field, which was concentrated below 1000 Hz.7° The microamp had
10 amplitude settings, which could be individually adjusted for each of the four channels. We used settings 1 (quiet treatment) and 8
(loud treatment) to produce vibrations at the center of the black velvet (signal-to-noise ratio 0-1000 Hz; quiet = 4.20 + 0.23 dB, loud =
31.96 + 0.32 dB) that varied similarly to field recordings of rural and urban sites by amplitude (~22 dB daily average range)*° and
shape of frequency profiles (Figure S2). We note that the lab playback was recorded using a laser vibrometer, while field recordings
were collected using a contact microphone,”° so comparisons of amplitudes (apart from range comparisons) between the field and
lab recordings are not possible. We also measured airborne sound levels at the center of the arena using a handheld sound level
meter (Cadrim; frequency range: 31.5-4000 Hz; resolution: 0.1 dB).
Mature female A. pennsylvanica constructed webs under either quiet or loud conditions for four consecutive nights between
September 5 and October 17, 2023. We chose four days as we observed a plateau in silk addition around the fourth day, though
Agelenopsis spiders continue adding silk beyond the fourth day. Future research should therefore examine web transmission across
different days of web construction. For each unique combination of rural/urban and treatment (rural/quiet; rural/loud; urban/quiet;
urban/loud), our sample size was 15 webs built by different females. We randomly assigned each spider to one of the six arenas
and ensured an even distribution of site/treatment groups across the six arenas. The temperature and light cycle during playback
were similar to the previously mentioned lab conditions. Spiders were not fed or provided water during these four days but were
fed two 1/8-inch crickets within 24 hours of their introduction to the arena. Since age influenced how this species used a microhabitat
that varied in vibratory noise levels in a previous study,”° we reduced variation in spider age as much as possible. We weighed and
photographed spiders with a size standard prior to their introduction to the playback. With these photographs, we measured the spi-
der’s body condition’' by calculating the residuals of the linear relationship between the log-transformed body mass and cephalo-
thorax width measured in ImageJ.°° We added the spider to the arena in a collection vial (Figure 3, fastened in place using Velcro) to
encourage retreat construction in the vial. We wrapped the embroidering loop with a six-cm-high six-mil mylar using Velcro to prevent
escape and coated the mylar in Vaseline to prevent silk attachment to the mylar. We covered the top with cling wrap to further prevent
escape. At the end of each trial, the velvet was replaced with new, and the collection vial was washed with dish soap.

Measuring Web Vibration Transmission
Immediately following four nights of web construction, we removed the speaker from the arena and rested the arena on a granite slab
that sat on top of two squares of acoustic foam (Figure 3B). In doing so, no vibratory playback occurred during recording, and
ambient vibrations were damped as much as possible. We attached a laser vibrometer (Polytec PDV-100) to a tripod, each leg of
which also rested on granite and acoustic foam. We set the laser vibrometer to record from the opening of the retreat, as that is
the spider’s typical foraging position where it rests its legs to receive incoming vibratory information from the web sheet. We recorded
from a small (2 mm x 2 mm) piece of white copier paper that we rested on the web using a low-pass of 22 kHz, no high-pass, and a

Current Biology 35, 1706-1715.e1-e4, April 21, 2025 e2


© CellPress Current Biology

velocity of 5 mm/s/V. The laser vibrometer had a frequency range from 0.5 to 22 kHz. We recorded from the same location for all trials
and for each spider (purple in Figure 3C).

To produce controlled vibrations on the web (hereafter, stimulus), we used a mini shaker (Briel & Kjaer, Model: 4810) with a #10
32-2 inch round head machine screw. We powered the shaker (without amplification) with a power amplifier (Briel & Kjeer,
Model:2718). The shaker was attached to a moveable arm (Manfrotto, Model 244, with camera bracket and clamp) using a four-
inch worm gear clamp. Since A. pennsylvanica webs are not sticky, the shaker could be moved to different locations on the web
without damaging the web with the head of the screw resting on the web surface (Figure 3B). We created the stimulus file by first
producing a file of white noise between 0 and 2000 Hz. We chose this range because the vibratory playback was concentrated below
1000 Hz, and we wanted to know whether vibratory frequencies above the range of noise differed in transmission between groups.
We then calibrated the surface of the shaker’s tip to vibrate all frequencies 0.5-2000 Hz at approximately equal amplitude (Figure 3D)
using an analog oscilloscope (Hameg Instruments, Model: HM303-6) and MixPre-6 interface, following the methodology of Michael
et al.°° The input gain of the MixPre-6 interface was calibrated to 28 dB and the output volume was set to 100. We determined that the
particle velocity of the surface of the shaker was 2.2 mm/s at 300 Hz.

We produced a one-second stimulus of calibrated and filtered white noise at six different positions on each web, thus varying the

distance that vibrations traveled to the retreat: three close (3.5 cm) to the retreat (hereafter short-distance transmission) and three far
(7 cm) from the retreat (hereafter longer-distance transmission) (Figure 3C). We repeated the one-second vibratory stimulus three
times at each position on the web, repositioning the shaker between each trial. As a result, we measured vibration transmission
18 times on each web (three trials at six positions). Simultaneously with the vibration stimulus from the shaker, we used Audacity®°
to record the resulting vibrations after transmission across the web with the laser vibrometer. Thus, any recorded deviations (purple
ine, Figure 3D) from the frequency profile of the shaker stimulus (yellow line, Figure 3D), would tell us the energy lost across different
requencies as they traveled across the web. We added one second of silence to the beginning of the stimulus file to record ambient
vibrations.
To investigate vibration energy dynamics in a relatively fine-scaled, frequency-dependent manner, we used Raven Pro’® (v. 1.6.5)
to measure the inband power (FFT length 8192, Hann window, 50% overlap, 0.186 s time resolution, 5.38 Hz frequency grid spacing)
in 5.38 Hz bins, because this was the smallest frequency bin size for this time-frequency resolution. We took these measurements
rom 0 to 2000 Hz (the last bin was 4.02 Hz from 1995.98 to 2000 Hz) for 0.5 seconds of ambient vibrations before the stimulus
(‘ambient’) and during vibrations from the stimulus (‘test’) (Figures SSA and S3B). All recordings were processed as a waveform
‘ormat with a 16-bit depth and a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz.

To remove background noise (i.e., calculate the signal-to-noise-ratio) for each recording and determine the energy loss relative to
the vibrations introduced by the stimulus, we followed the calculations outlined by Ringler et al.,°° with additional details provided in
Figure S3. The calculations involved converting from the logarithmic (decibel, dB) scale to linear units. To remove any equipment or
room noise, we used the ‘ambient’ and ‘test’ 0.5-second segments from the same recording to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of
each trial (Figure S3F). Similarly, we recorded directly from the surface of the stimulus using the vibrometer to measure the energy
being introduced to the web at the point of contact and calculated the signal-to-noise ratio from 0.5-second ambient and test seg-
ments of this recording (Figure S3E).

While it would have been ideal to record the stimulus directly at the point of contact for each recording, this was not feasible
because the shaker needed to be perpendicular to the web, and the base of the shaker would block the laser. To help account
for any slight variation in masses on the web, we averaged the nine trials of short-distance transmission and the nine trials of
longer-distance transmission from the retreat of each web because vibration transmission was similar across positions of similar
transmission distances (Figure S4). We computed these averages using the linear scale of the signal-to-noise ratio to avoid the math-
ematical distortion of averaging logarithmic values. After averaging the linear values, we converted all signal-to-noise values back to
the more familiar logarithmic (dB) scale. Last, because the signal-to-noise ratio resulted in a stimulus that lacked a flat response
across the frequency range (Figures 3D and S3E, yellow line) we subtracted the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus from each re-
corded vibration trial at each frequency bin. This new metric measures the energy loss (or attenuation, in dB) of the recorded signal
as the vibrations transmitted across the web from the point of production by the stimulus (now, 0 dB energy loss).

Upon removing the arena from the speaker, the spider retreated to the back of the retreat and did not move during the recordings.
Preliminary trials where the spider was removed did not show a difference in the frequency profile of the web, suggesting that the
spider’s mass in this location had negligible effects on the overall vibration dynamics.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Spiders’ Responses to Pure Tone Frequencies

To test whether rural or urban spiders exhibited differences in the range of frequencies they attacked (a range within known environ-
mental noise that is relevant to A. pennsylvanica foraging), we used a binomial generalized additive model (attacked = 1, did not
attack = 0) with frequency as a smoothed term varying by rural/urban. In the global model, we included collection site (Figure 1A,
R1, R2, U1, or U2), year (2022 or 2023), age, and previous lab treatment experience (none, microhabitat use, quiet, or loud, see
Table S1) as random effects. Although some spiders had prior vibratory experience in previous experiments, we do not believe
this influenced the results, as it was dropped from the model for lack of improving model fit (see results: spider responses to pure
tone frequencies). Moreover, all webs in this experiment were constructed under the same ambient lab conditions since our web

transmission experiment shows that webs are significantly impacted by the vibratory conditions during web construction (see
Figure 4). However, further research is needed to understand how the duration of noise exposure and time elapsed since such expo-
sure affects behaviors like foraging. We used a basic dimension (k) of 10, which diagnostic tests suggested was an adequate value.
We used backward selection by dropping non-significant terms one-by-one. To determine if the variables in the final model played a
meaningful role in explaining spider attack behavior, we tested the final model against the null model using an ANOVA with a Wald
Chi-Square statistic and compared the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values. We repeated this analysis on the order of fre-
quencies presented (to test for habituation), and responses to the first frequency only (to control for habituation). To test whether
overall attack probabilities differed between rural and urban spiders, we used pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means.

Noise Effects on Web Vibration Transmission

To first test for differences in age and body condition, we performed an ANOVA with a Wald Chi-Square statistic for the interaction
between rural/urban and treatment. To look for differences in energy loss of different frequencies as they travel across webs built by
rural and urban spiders and under quiet or loud vibratory treatments, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) with a smoothed
term across frequencies by unique rural/urban x treatment groups (rural/quiet; rural/loud; urban/quiet; urban/loud). We used a single
variable for rural/urban x treatment so that we could test for differences between the four groups, and because GAMs do not handle
interactions within smoothed terms. We used a basic dimension (k) of 10 for the smooth term. While increasing k improved model fit
due to the noisiness of the raw data, it did not change the results. We performed separate analyses for short-distance versus longer-
distance vibration transmission from the stimulus with a sample size of 15 webs per rural/urban x treatment group. To determine if the
variables in the final model played a significant role in explaining energy lost during web transmission, we compared this model to the
null model (the model lacking any predictor values) using an ANOVA with a Wald Chi-Square statistic and using AIC values. To
compare average energy loss between site/treatment groups in relevant frequency ranges, we performed pairwise comparisons
of the estimated marginal means from generalized additive models. Specifically, we performed separate analyses for frequencies
below 1000 Hz (overlapping with known noise) and above 1000 Hz (outside the range of known noise). For significant pairwise dif-
ferences (based on Tukey-adjusted P-values), we examined non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals to identify the specific fre-
quency ranges where energy loss varied between pairs.

We also tested the properties of the silk (total silk mass and percent moisture) of the webs built during vibratory noise playback
following recording web vibration transmission, and we provided these findings in supplemental material (see Figure S6).

All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed using R®' (v. 4.2.2) in RStudio®° (v. 2023.09.0+463). We used the mgev
package’ to perform generalized additive models, the emmeans package’’ to perform pairwise comparisons, and the tidyverse
package’° to graph the model predictions. We used the car package” to perform ANOVA tests. The tables were produced using
the flextable package°° or Microsoft Word. All data and code are accessible at https://github.com/brandipessman/vibration_
