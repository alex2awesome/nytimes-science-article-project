Abstract

Remains of megatheres have been known since the 18th -century and were among the first megafaunal vertebrates to be
studied. While several examples of preserved integument show a thick coverage of fur for smaller ground sloths living in
cold climates such as Mylodon and Nothrotheriops, comparatively very little is known about megathere skin. Assuming a
typical placental mammal metabolism, it was previously hypothesized that megatheres would have had little-to-no fur as
they achieved giant body sizes. Here the “hairless model of integument” is tested using geochemical analyses to estimate
body temperature to generate novel models of ground sloth metabolism, fur coverage, and paleoclimate with Niche Map-
per software. The simulations assuming metabolic activity akin to those of modern xenarthrans suggest that sparse fur
coverage would have resulted in cold stress across most latitudinal ranges inhabited by extinct ground sloths. Specifically,
Eremotherium predominantly required dense 10 mm fur with implications for seasonal changes of coat depth in north-
ernmost latitudes and sparse fur in the tropics; Megatherium required dense 30 mm fur year-round in its exclusive range
of cooler, drier climates; Mylodon and Nothrotheriops required dense 10-50 mm fur to avoid thermal stress, matching
the integument remains of both genera, and further implying the use of behavioral thermoregulation. Moreover, clumped
isotope paleothermometry data from the preserved teeth of four genera of ground sloth yielded reconstructed body tem-
peratures lower than those previously reported for large terrestrial mammals (29+2°-32+3° C). This combination of low
metabolisms and thick fur allowed ground sloths to inhabit various environments.

Xenarthrans have a rich and diverse history preserved in the
fossil record dating back 60 million years ago (MYA) to the
Eocene Epoch. The Xenarthra consists of the clades Cingu-
lata, comprising living armadillos and the extinct pampa-
theres and glyptodonts, and Pilosa, which contains anteaters
and sloths. While the genera Choloepus (two-toed sloths)
and Bradypus (three-toed sloths) are the only extant linages
of (tree) sloths, numerous extinct genera of sloths (i.e., arbo-
real, terrestrial, and aquatic) once occupied various niches
during the Oligocene and persisted until the Late Pleisto-
cene. Ground sloths thrived throughout South America and
dispersed north to eventually colonize North America dur-
ing the late Cenozoic Great American Biotic Interchange
(GABI) (Feldhamer et al. 2007). Several extinct ground

sloth taxa such as Eremotherium and Megatherium became
the largest xenarthrans ever in existence, reaching sizes
comparable to or exceeding that of modern African savanna
elephants.

To date, preserved integument that is definitively
attributed to the largest ground sloths Eremotherium and
Megatherium has yet to be found. The only specimen
of Megatherium having a sample of skin was lost before
it could be inventoried (Pujos and Salas 2004). Nonethe-
less, both taxa have been historically reconstructed as
having a thick coat of long, shaggy fur similar to that of
smaller ground sloths (e.g., Mylodon and Nothrotheriops)
and extant tree sloths. This appearance, however, was
challenged on the basis of thermal energetics suggesting
a largely hairless integument in the largest ground sloths
(McNab 1985; Farifia 2002). These analyses utilized the
following thermal conductivity equation: (Pong = (Kgyin/S)
X (Tinner~ Tekin)» Where ®,,,4 is the heat flow density of the
skin, ky j, is the thermal conductivity of the skin, s is the
skin thickness, and core body temperature and ambient
temperature is represented by T;,,,., and T,jin, respectively.
Farifia (2002) hypothesized that given their massive sizes,
the large-bodied ground sloths would not have been ther-
mally neutral if they were covered in thick fur. However,
if the integument of Megatherium closely mirrored that of
the largest extant terrestrial mammals (i.e., elephants, hip-
popotamuses, and rhinoceroses), then it would be in a ther-
moneutral zone even if the surrounding temperatures were
nearly — 17° C on average. A thermoneutral zone is defined
as a range of ambient temperatures where an endotherm can
remain in heat balance without metabolic heat production
or requiring evaporative heat loss. While it is tempting to
make comparisons to extensively furry megafauna such as
the woolly mammoth, it should be noted that these compari-
sons are not applicable to megatheres. Woolly mammoths
had a suite of adaptations for living in the frigid Siberia tun-
dra such as reduced ear and tail sizes and an insulating layer
of fat (Boeskorov et al. 2016), as well as hemoglobin that
prevented their blood from freezing (Campbell et al. 2010).

The “hairless model of integument” was again recently
evoked by Lindsey et al. (2020) regarding a mass assem-
blage of Eremotherium remains recovered from Tanque
Loma in Ecuador. The cause of death of these animals was
believed to be disease (or drought) from fecal matter con-
tamination of the marsh. Lindsey et al. (2020) postulated
that wallowing behavior would be advantageous if E. /auril-
lardi had a hairless integument, as it would offer protection
against the sun and tropical insects, and thus would be simi-
lar to a protective strategy used by the largest-bodied extant
terrestrial mammals.

Despite evidence in favor of a hairless (or nearly hairless)
model of integument in the largest ground sloths that ever

lived, there were critical assumptions applied to the previous
methodologies that may not be tenable. First, the thermal
conductivity equation used by Farifia (2002) only accounts
for core body temperatures and the effects of ambient tem-
peratures alone on thermoneutrality without accounting for
other environmental factors. While this calculation is useful
in determining heat conduction flux, other environmental
factors that could impact thermoneutrality such as relative
humidity and wind speed, in addition to variations in ambi-
ent temperature across the broad geographic distribution of
the ground sloth genera should have been considered. Sec-
ond, the previous model (Farifia 2002) did not accurately
account for the basal metabolism of extant xenarthrans for
calculations of heat flux, or the thick skin of living sloths
that would affect heat loss. Instead, the basal metabolic rate
of a naked human was isometrically scaled up to the size
of Megatherium assuming similar core body temperature
and skin thickness to that of hominids (Farifia 2002). Third,
determinations of the basal metabolic rate of Megatherium
americanum were made by halving the estimated metabolic
rate, thus leading to the conclusions that it could still be fur-
less and that temperatures as low as -10° C would be within
its thermoneutral zone. Fourth, thermoneutral zone esti-
mates derived from the previous model for smaller ground
sloth taxa are inconsistent with known paleoclimate data
and preserved integument. Temperatures of -4° C and —28°
C, respectively, have also been calculated as being within
the thermoneutral zone for a completely furless Mylodon
darwinii versus a conspecific with a fur coat 4 cm long, but
with each having an equivalent mass of 2,000 kg. (Farifia
2002).

The fossil evidence known for Mylodon, however, indi-
cates that it was extensively covered in fur, which was as
long as 6.5—10 cm in some regions of its body (Collins 1933;
Santos et al. 2024). Stable isotopes found in contemporary
samples of Notiomastodon enamel dating to 33,661—10,239
years ago have also produced mean annual temperature esti-
mates ranging between 9° C and 21° C (Gonzalez-Guarda et
al. 2017). Moreover, the relationship between body mass and
body temperature in mammals is complex and purported to
be mediated primarily through ecology (Clarke and Rothery
2008). Recent data on large extant mammal energetics indi-
cate that the thermoneutral zone only accounts for favor-
able ambient temperature ranges where little energy needs
to be expended beyond the basal metabolic rate, and not
the full extent of the normal functions associated with daily
activity such as foraging. Thus, prescriptive zones, toler-
ance zones, and survival zones have been adopted by other
authors (Mitchell et al. 2018; Boyles et al. 2019; Levesque
and Marshall 2021), which encompass temperatures where
an endotherm can function normally, temperatures where

Journal of Mammalian Evolution (2025) 32:1

thermal stress occurs, and temperatures where death by
thermal stress occurs, respectively.

Recently, Varela et al. (2024) attempted to estimate the
metabolic rates of several extinct xenarthrans by measuring
the diameter of the femoral nutrient foramina. Estimates of
blood flow obtained from an equation developed by Sey-
mour et al. (2019) resulted in metabolic rates in fossil xen-
arthrans comparable to non-xenarthran placental mammals
of similar size. While these findings lend support to specula-
tion that ground sloths possessed a typical placental metab-
olism due to increased skeletal muscle mass compared to
living tree sloths (Farifia 2002), and faced environmental
conditions below proposed thermal neutrality (Tejada et al.
2021), other data suggests a more xenarthran-like metab-
olism. For example, estimates of the body temperature in
Nothrotheriops (based on amino acids preserved in bone
collagen) showed that it had a range of body temperature
values akin to extant xenarthrans (Ho 1967). Similar esti-
mates of the metabolic rates and thermal conductivity for
both Mylodon and Nothrotheriops suggest that each had low
basal metabolic rate and relatively poor insulation compared
with other mammals of similar size (McNab 1985). Ground
sloths plausibly may have had lower metabolic rates than
other mammals of their size, although this tentative conclu-
sion does not imply that they were as slow-moving as living
tree sloths. Using step length from a fossilized trackway at
Pehuén Co, Argentina attributed to Megatherium, Blanco
and Czerwonogora (2003) predicted that its average walking
speed was ~ 1.21 ms !, which is 10 times faster than extant
Bradypus suspensory walking below-branch (Gorvet et al.
2020; McKamy et al. 2023). A maximum speed of nearly
2.2 ms!, which is still considerably slower than the top
velocity of 5-6 ms"! measured for elephants (Hutchinson
et al. 2006), also has been estimated for Megatherium (Bil-
let et al. 2013). Despite ground sloths, elephants, and tree
sloths having different modes of locomotion, their reported
speeds emphasize the general principle that animals with
low metabolic rates tend to move more slowly than those
with higher metabolic rates.

The objective of this research is to further test the hairless
model of integument for the largest ground sloths, Eremoth-
erium and Megatherium, and to place novel constraints on
their thermoregulation. To rigorously test the model through
quantitative means, numerous climatic and physiological
factors were input, for example core body temperature,
metabolic rate, and estimates of paleoclimate. Simultane-
ously, integrating these variables will provide more insight
into the reconstruction of large ground sloth integument
until skin and/or fur samples are discovered. In addition to
physiological and ecological constraints on integument, a
better understanding of the evolution of core body tempera-
ture and/or metabolic rate across various extinct and extant

phylogenetic branches of the Folivora is an expected out-
come of this study.

Materials and methods
Fossil specimens and sample preparation

Tooth samples from Eremotherium (N=2), Megatherium
(N= 1), Promegatherium (N= 1), and Nothrotheriops (N= 1)
were used in a series of geochemical analyses (Table 1).
Cortical bone samples from either the same specimen or
from another in the same general locality were also used to
determine the degree of diagenesis via an analysis of rare
earth element (REE) uptake in both cortical bone and tooth
samples. The specimens obtained were from the collec-
tions of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago,
IL (FMNH) and the University of Florida in Gainesville,
FL (UF). No permits were required for the present study,
which complied with all relevant legal regulations. While
no samples of Mylodon were obtained for this study, body
temperature estimates for this genus were extrapolated from
values obtained from Promegatherium given that both gen-
era were similar in body size. This comparison based on
body size rather than phylogeny is justifiable given that
Bradypus and Choloepus are similar in size and metabolic
capabilities despite being distantly related (McNab 1985;
Cliffe et al. 2023). The sampling strategy accounted for a
wide collective geographic distribution of these genera from
the southernmost extreme of their range in Argentina to the
northernmost extreme of their range in Florida.

Given that the outer dentin of fossil xenarthran teeth are
susceptible to large quantities of rare earth element uptake
(MacFadden et al. 2010), inner orthodentine was preferen-
tially sampled, as a recent study (Larmon et al. 2019) using
cathodoluminescence revealed that this dental material is
the most resistant tissue to diagenesis and exhibits the least
amount of mineral impregnation compared to other dentine
layers. Approximately 300-400 mg of powderized inter-
nal orthodentine (and cortical bone) were harvested with a
power hand drill fit with a 0.7 mm diamond-tipped drill bit.
Drilled samples of inner orthodentine were taken from sev-
eral random sites along the entire length of the tooth starting
at the apex to the root (Fig. 1a). To remove any organic con-
taminants, the samples were washed with 5.0+0.5 ml of 3%
H,O, for 3 h in 15 ml conicals. The tubes remained open so
that CO, could be released during purification. The samples
were then pelleted in a centrifuge at 10k rpm (centrifuga-
tion radius= 12 cm; centrifugal force= 13,416 g) for 10 min.
Specifically, all samples were centrifuged at a constant tem-
perature of 25° C, followed by 3 rinses in room temperature
ddH,O water. Any remaining liquid was decanted before

drying overnight in an oven at 50° C. Extra drying time in
the oven was necessary for some of the samples to ensure
complete desiccation of contaminants so that the samples
were dried to a concentrated mass.

Geochemical alteration analysis

To assess the amount of diagenesis present in the samples,
REE analyses were performed on subsamples (5—10 mg) of
prepared inner orthodentine and cortical bone (MacFadden
et al. 2010). For analysis, samples were weighed by micro-
balance and digested in a mixture of 0.1 mL 29 M HF and 0.3
mL 16 M HNO; ona hotplate at 150 °C. Samples were dried
down and redissolved in 0.5 ml of 16 M HNO, three times
prior to diluting gravimetrically to 2% HNO; for analysis.
Samples were prepared along-side a suite of geologic and
bone standard powders and total procedural blank following
the same dissolution procedure, for use as calibration and
external reference materials. Analyses were performed on a
Thermo Scientific, iCAP-RQ, single quadrupole mass spec-
trometer using a PFA micromist nebulizer; peltier-cooled
quartz, cyclonic spray chamber, 2.5 mm quartz injector and
quartz torch; Ni cones, high matrix (3.5 mm) skimmer insert.
Samples were uptaken using an ESI SC 4DX FAST autos-
ampler using the FAST 2.0 mL method, with a stabilization
time of 30s and dual rinse (4 s each) in 4% HNO3 + trace
HF following each analysis. Samples were mixed in real-
time with a 2 ppb In solution using the FAST autosampler,
which was used as an internal standard for the experiment.
Reported analyses are the mean of 5 measurements, which

16519, Er Tm, '2Vb, Lu, Spb, 38U, for 10 ms
each. Raw counts were normalized to a uniform intensity
over the run by normalizing against In. Concentrations were
converted from normalized counts using Thermo Scientific
Qtegra software (eQuant) by linear regression of the calibra-
tion standards (BHVO-2, BCR-2, BIR-1, AGV-2; Jochum et
al. 2016), anchored to the total procedural blank. Accuracy
and precision were monitored using whole rock powder
W2 (Jochum et al. 2016), NIST1400 bone ash, NIST1486
bone meal and NOCS fossil bone material (Chavagnac et
al. 2007) and multiple dilutions of a mixed 100 ppm REE
standard solution (BDH82025-926) diluted to similar con-
centrations as the unknowns.

All measurements were normalized against Post-
Archean Australian Shale (PAAS; Nance and Taylor 1976)
to compensate for the effects of the Oddo-Harkins even-odd
abundance effect. While MacFadden et al. (2010) reported
a significant increase in REE uptake in fossils compared to
modern bone and dental tissues, an REE index was estab-
lished to assess the degree of diagenesis in fossil xenarthran
teeth compared to enamel samples from similar localities.
The sum of all normalized REE (REEj) present in ortho-
dentine were divided by the sum of all normalized REE
found in cortical bone and expressed as a ratio (REE, sam-
ple/REE, cortical bone). Ratios>1.0 indicate significant
geochemical alteration signifying that isotopic geochemical
data should be treated with caution, whereas sample ratios
between 0.5 and 1.0 indicate mild to moderately altered

was weighed out in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes and dis-
solved overnight in 2.0 M nitric acid (HNO;). Calcium
fluoride (CaF) was then precipitated with the addition of
2.9 M hydrofluoric acid (HF) and 2.0 M sodium hydroxide
(NaOH). Samples were centrifuged to pellet CaF, and the
phosphate ion containing supernatant was transferred to a
new clean microcentrifuge tube. The CaF, pellet was rinsed
with 0.1 M sodium fluoride (NaF) to recover residual phos-
phate, and the resulting supernatant aliquot was combined

Bioapatite stable isotope geochemistry and body
temperature estimates

Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is an approach to
determine mineral formation temperatures based on mea-
surements (which are reported as A,7 values) of the abun-
dance of '3C-'8O bonds in carbonate moieties (Ghosh et al.
2006). The Ay; values found in tooth bioapatite reflect the
body temperature of the organism that formed them (Eagle
et al. 2010). Furthermore, Ay; measurements of vertebrate
biominerals are able to distinguish between endothermic and
ectothermic physiology (Eagle et al. 2011, 2015; Griffiths
et al. 2023), as well as between endotherms with different
metabolic rates. For example, these techniques have played
a crucial role in resolving body temperature differences
between regionally endothermic sharks, large terrestrial and
marine mammals, and between mammals and birds. Mea-
surements from fossils also yielded plausible body temper-
atures for extinct vertebrates across of a range of epochs
(Eagle et al. 2010, 2011, 2015; Griffiths et al. 2023).

All samples were analyzed via stable isotope ratio mass
spectrometry. Specifically, samples of ground sloth inner
orthodentine were digested in a common acid bath contain-
ing 105 wt% phosphoric acid reacted at 90° C followed by
multiple steps of cryogenic purification and passage through
either a gas chromatograph column (MAT 253 mass spec-
trometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) or adsorption trap
(Nu Perspective mass spectrometer, Nu Instruments-AME-
TEK, UK) packed with Porapak Type-QTM 50/80. Follow-
ing sample purification, CO, gas was then introduced into
the isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) systems via an
automated changeover block, thus allowing for continu-
ous alternating measurements of sample and reference CO,
gas on detectors configured to measure isotopologues of
masses 44 to 49. Measurements performed on the Thermo
MAT 253 mass spectrometer (~ 60-80 mg of sample mate-
rial) consisted of nine blocks of 10 cycles totaling 720 s of
integration time at a signal of 16—15.7 V over the course of
a block with pressure adjustments between each block to
return to a beam of 16 V at the start of each new block. Mea-
surements taken with the Nu Perspective mass spectrometer
(~7-10 mg of sample material) consisted of three blocks
of 20 cycles totaling in 1,200 s of integration at a signal
which ranged from 80 to 30 nA on mass 44 over the course
of each acquisition. Carbonate standards ETH-1 and ETH-2
were used to perform a nonlinearity correction on sample

unknowns. These nonlinearity corrected values were then
projected into an I-CDES reference frame (Bernasconi et al.
2021) using ETH-1-2, and ETH-3 along with three in-house
standards. ETH-4 was not included in the corrections and
was instead used as a check for data quality. Corrections
were applied to tooth samples and standard data over a mov-
ing average of 10 standards on either side of a given sample
and were calculated using Easotope software (John and
Bowen 2016). Reconstructed temperatures were derived
from a A,7-temperature calibration method (Anderson et al.
2021) that has recently demonstrated that using the latest
I-CDES reference frame a bioapatite calibration was statis-
tically indistinguishable from the calibration used in these
analyses (Anderson et al. 2021; Griffiths et al. 2023). Equa-
tions used to estimate the formation of waters during min-
eralization are published elsewhere (Lécuyer et al. 2010).

An accepted limitation in the application of clumped
isotope thermometry for assessing vertebrate physiology is
the preservation of original isotope signatures and the pos-
sibility of post-depositional diagenesis, and how these fac-
tor influence the accuracy of the estimates. While precisely
constraining diagenesis can be complex, the following two
approaches were employed: (1) determining the REE con-
centration of fossil ground sloth teeth and (2) comparing
measurements of 8!80 of both the carbonate and phosphate
moieties of fossil bioapatite. As the carbonate moiety may
be more susceptible to chemical alteration than the phos-
phate moiety deviation, the offset between the range of
carbonate and phosphate seen in extant organisms has been
used to indicate preferential diagenesis of the carbonate
moiety (Eagle et al. 2011). Rare earth elements can be taken
up by bioapatite during the fossilization process and very
high REE content may be indicative of recrystallization of
the fossil apatite (McFadden et al. 2010).

Modeling of animals and paleoclimate

Body temperature estimates obtained from the literature for
extant xenarthrans (McNab 1985; Cliffe et al. 2018; Seitz
and Puig 2018) were evaluated via linear regression to
determine the relationship between core body temperature
and body size for all initial simulations. Temperature (in
°C) was log-transformed and plotted against the log of mass
(in kg) to establish an expected relationship. These data
showed no relationship among extant xenarthrans (Fig. 2);
however, extant xenarthran body masses range between 0.2
and 45.2 kg, thus none of the taxa used for this scaling rela-
tionship approximate the body size of extinct ground sloths.
Nonetheless, modeling simulations were meant to represent
an average adult-sized animal at any given point in geologic
time, but are not meant to be based on a specific specimen
such as those used in the clumped isotope analyses. Body

Body Temperature (°C)

temperature estimates, derived from clumped isotope paleo-
thermometer analyses among various other environmental
and physiological variables were input into the broadly
tested biophysiological modeling software, Niche Mapper.
The microclimate sub-model of Niche Mapper converts
inputs of macroclimate values into the warmest (minimum
shade) and coolest (maximum shade) microclimates simul-
taneously from 2 m above ground to 2 m below ground.
The animal sub-model then uses the hourly results in order
to find a microenvironment suitable for optimal thermal
comfort, while allowing the user to define various mor-
phological, behavioral, and physiological inputs, including
animal body geometry, user defined metabolic rate, denning
and burrowing behaviors, etc. Both sub-models solve for
heat and mass balances of the local substrates and the ani-
mal, respectively, in addition to finding the best available
microclimate for each hour of a simulated day to keep the
simulated animal within the closest possible range of the
thermoneutral zone.

Recent work with Niche Mapper has been used to predict
both environmental and physiological constraints on vari-
ous extinct taxa, including mammoths (Wang et al. 2018,
2020) and Triassic dinosaurs (Lovelace et al. 2020). Basal
metabolic rate was estimated using a published metabolic
scaling relationship derived from 15 extant xenarthran spe-
cies (3.14 M°;White and Seymour 2004), where M is
body mass in grams, and the resulting basal metabolic rate
in ml O,/hr | was converted into the unit of watts. An activ-
ity multiplier of 2 was used to estimate values of field meta-
bolic rate. The scaling relationship (3.3 M°’°; Farifia 2002),
where M is body mass in kg, was originally derived from
Kleiber (1932) and it was used to compare metabolic rates
derived from a mammal of similar body size with the typical
placental metabolism.

log, Body Mass (kg)

Three-dimensional computer models for both Eremoth-
erium and Mylodon were fitted with non-uniform rational
basis spline (NURBS) curves and used to estimate body vol-
umes, surface areas, and rate of heat dissipation, and these
data further served as proxies for the same computed param-
eters in metabolic models for Megatherium and Nothrothe-
riops, respectively. The models were constructed in ZBrush
by paleoartists, and we’re used in this study with permis-
sion. While distantly related phylogenetically, the 3D model
of Mylodon was specifically used as a proxy for Nothroth-
eriops given that both taxa were more similar in body size
than either were to the megatheres. Mass estimates for Ere-
motherium (4,490 kg; Barbosa et al. 2023), Megatherium
(3,706 kg; Brassey and Gardiner 2015), Mylodon (1,986 kg;
Christiansen and Farifia 2003), and Nothrotheriops (463 kg;
McDonald 2005) were input into these simulations. While
higher mass estimates have been reported in the literature
for both Eremotherium and Megatherium (6,550 kg; Dantas
et al. 2017; 6,000 kg; Farifia et al. 1998), these were treated
as high-end estimates herein, and more conservative body
masses were used instead. Models of full body fur cover-
age were tested at coat thicknesses of 10, 30, and 50 mm
for all four taxa. Fur densities that were tested specifically
consisted of “dense” fur of 2,000 hairs/em* (Lovelace et
al. 2020) and 1,300 hairs/cm? (e.g., horse flank fur density;
Tregear 1965), in addition to “sparse” fur of 8.5 hairs/em
(e.g., pig flank fur density; Tregear 1965) and 0.07 hairs/
cm? (maximum elephant fur density; Myhrvold et al. 2012).

Metabolic chamber simulations for each taxon were
used to estimate approximate thermoneutral zone, as well
as lower critical temperature and upper critical tempera-
tures. The final core body temperature ranges used were
derived from those determined by the clumped isotope
paleothermometry analysis, as well as published core body
temperatures from extant xenarthrans (McNab 1985; Cliffe

ay Springer

et al. 2018; Seitz and Puig 2018). Output thermoneutral
zones were determined within a target range of 5% + basal
metabolic rate with the animal modeled as standing still
with no exposure to sunlight. Constant wind speeds of 0.1
ms ! were also assumed for the metabolic chamber simula-
tions. The upper critical temperature was determined when
the metabolic rate fell below 5% of the target basal meta-
bolic rate range, while the lower critical temperature was
determined when the metabolic rate was above 5% of the
target basal metabolic rate range as per previous analyses
(Lovelace et al. 2020). This process was repeated for each
proposed integument model.

To account for environmental conditions of the fossil
localities (beyond ambient temperatures) during the Pleis-
tocene, the Paleobiology Database (https://paleobiodb.org)
was used to determine the northernmost and southernmost
ranges, in addition to a mid-latitude species range to test
for a variety of climatic conditions for each taxon. Aver-
age yearly temperatures corresponding to the approximate
stratigraphical ages of the simulated localities were obtained
from previously published PALEO-PGEM v1.0 simulations
of various global mean annual temperatures over a span of
5 million years with a total of 5,001 measurements in 1,000-
year increments (Holden et al. 2019). The global climate
extractor in Niche Mapper was then used to determine the
factored difference from modern climate values of monthly
maximum and minimum temperature for the estimated
stratigraphical age of the locality. Relative humidity, cloud
cover, and wind speed were approximated from modern val-
ues measured by global climate extractor database in Niche
Mapper for similar regions. The microclimate model in
Niche Mapper converts these user-specified monthly max/
min climate data into hourly values using sinusoidal func-
tions that assume the same weather conditions for each day
of a given month. The model then solves for heat and water
mass balance for the ground surface and the temperatures,
wind speeds, and humidity (2 m above and below ground
level). Solar radiation is computed from an embedded solar
radiation algorithm (McCullough and Porter 1971). Sky
thermal radiation was computed from an empirical regres-
sion based on the input for the 2 m above ground air tem-
perature (Idso and Jackson 1969).

Finally, for the Niche Mapper simulations of ground
sloths in their respective environments, a thermal comfort
zone was determined for the estimated daily metabolic rate
requirements for each taxon based on likely upper and lower
bounds of daily metabolic activity. Total daily metabolic
expenditure was calculated using a trapezoidal integration
of hourly metabolic rate predictions. The lower bound of the
target zone was determined by multiplying estimated basal
metabolic rate in kJ/hr ! by 24, while the upper bound was
determined by multiplying estimated field metabolic rate

(i.e., basal metabolic rate multiplied by a factor of 2 con-
verted to kJ/hr') by the same factor. Within this zone, the
simulated animals could function at normal metabolic lev-
els as long as resources were readily available. For simplic-
ity, zones of tolerance and survival above the upper bounds
of the upper limits of the modeled thermal comfort zone
are referred to herein as “cold stress” since the simulated
animal would be expending additional metabolic energy
to prevent hypothermia. Likewise, zones of tolerance and
survival below the lower bounds of the thermal comfort
zone are referred to as “heat stress” as the simulated animal
would have to lower its metabolic rate below its estimated
basal metabolic rate to prevent hyperthermia. The results
of Farifia (2002) provided a sensitivity analysis to compare
the thermal tolerances of ground sloths with metabolic rates
more akin to large placental mammals, as opposed to a xen-
arthran-like metabolism.

Statistical analysis

Predictions of daily metabolic rate (in kJ day”') that were
generated by the climate simulations of each integument
(fur coverage) model were plotted as a series of curves to
determine which model best fit the estimated minimum and
maximum daily metabolic rate expenditures, or the hours
per day where basal metabolic rate can be maintained with-
out the need for seeking shade, for each taxon. Once the
integument models with the least amount of thermal stress
were established, estimates of maximum hours of meta-
bolic activity beyond levels of basal metabolic rate were
compared across the geographic distribution of each taxon
along with those of extant placental mammals of similar
size ranges. Daily food consumption averages in kg/day !
extrapolated from integument models with the least amount
of thermal stress for each simulated environment were fitted
with a second-order polynomial regression curve to indicate
possible differences in food intake among taxa. Nutritional
value of leaves, grasses, and woody plants were derived
from the DairyOne feed composition library (https://apps.
dairyone.com/feedcomposition/; see Online Resource | for
full list of climate and physiology parameters), and the wet
mass in kg of forage consumed was additionally estimated
from these simulations. The consumed food data were also
fitted with second order polynomial regressions to statisti-
cally evaluate patterns of monthly food consumption in the
respective predicted habitats of the sampled fossil taxa.

Results
Clumped isotope paleothermometry and REE ratios

Calculated REE index ratios for a majority of specimens
analyzed here fell below a value of 1.0 indicating little dia-
genetic alteration in the samples (Table 1). An exception
was the Promegatherium specimen (FMNH P 14511), which
yielded a REE index value of 36.6 and was considered to be
likely diagenetically altered or an impure sample. The Ere-
motherium specimen (UF 312730) had the lowest REE ratio
(0.02) that is consistent with both dentine to cortical bone
REE index values determined for other individuals found
at Halie 7G (range; 0.004—0.01; MacFadden et al. 2010;
Online Resource 2). Both the Eremotherium (REE ratio;
0.42) and Nothrotheriops (REE ratio; 0.86) tooth speci-
mens recovered from Inglis 1 A and Leisey | A, respec-
tively, also fell within the known variation of REE index
values recorded for fossils from individuals at both locali-
ties (range; 0.33—-0.72; MacFadden et al. 2010). The cor-
responding clumped isotope data from the Promegatherium
specimen FMNH P14511 resulted in a mean temperature
estimate of 23+5° C and was determined to be too low for
a realistic body temperature of a large mammal, being more
similar to the lower end of body temperature estimates of
ectotherms determined by similar previous analyses (Eagle
et al. 2011, 2015; Griffiths et al. 2023). It is noted that the
carbonate-phosphate 5!°O offset was within the bounds of
most extant vertebrates, indicating that alteration of the car-
bonate moiety may be subtle rather than extensive (Fig. 1b).

Despite its low REE index, the Eremotherium specimen
UF 312730 exhibited poor replication between analyses
(high standard error; Table 1) and yielded clumped isotopic
temperature estimates which are implausible to be in a phys-
iologic range. This was likely the consequence of organic
contamination that had not successfully been removed by
pre-cleaning of the tooth specimen and/or incomplete CO,
cleanup stages of sample purification, as neither phosphate
5'80 and REE indicated diagenesis (Table 1; Fig. 1b). This
hypothesis is supported by the observed abnormally high
A4g values (Fig. 1c; Online Resource 2) in this sample
indicative of the presence contamination creating isobaric
interferences for clumped isotope measurements. The three
remaining teeth specimens of Eremotherium, Nothroth-
eriops, and Megatherium that had low REE and carbonate-
phosphate 6!8O offsets in the range of extant mammals
(Table 1; Fig. 1b) yielded clumped isotope temperatures of
29+2° C, 32+3° C, and 31+1° C, respectively, with good
agreement between replicate analyses and relatively low A4g
values (Fig. lc). As per established criteria, there is no rea-
son to suspect that these samples are compromised by dia-
genesis or analytical artifacts, thus the resulting estimates
are likely to represent the core body temperatures of extinct
ground sloths.

Estimates of paleoclimate and physiological
parameters

A wide range of ambient temperatures were modeled for the
four genera of ground sloths analyzed (Fig. 3). The largest,
Eremotherium, was predicted to have experienced variable
ambient temperatures (range: 1.89-30.1° C) throughout its
extensive geographic range, though the lowest values were
determined by outliers. The predicted ambient temperature
differences for Nothrotheriops were similar in absolute val-
ues to Eremotherium, but colder minimum ambient tem-
peratures were estimated for this taxon (range: -3.2—25.4°
C). Both Megatherium and Mylodon, however, were pre-
dicted to primarily have inhabited cold-to-temperate envi-
ronments with minimum and maximum temperature values
overlapping with the temperature ranges for Eremotherium
and Nothrotheriops (Fig. 4). Estimated basal metabolic rate
values for all four taxa sampled did not exceed 1,000 W
(Fig. 4); all metabolic rate estimates were 59-66% less than
those approximated by previous analysis of Farifia (2002).

Metabolic chamber simulations and thermoneutral
zone ranges

Metabolic chamber analyses revealed broad thermoneutral

zones for dense fur (1,300-2,000 hairs/cm7) across all four
genera that decreased with an increase in coat thickness

Eremotherium Megatherium

(Fig. 5). Both Eremotherium and Megatherium had similar
thermoneutral zones with coat thicknesses of 10 mm (range;
4.5—22.6° C, combined for both taxa), which overlap with
the estimated ambient temperature values that both genera
would have experienced throughout their geographic dis-
tribution (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, Megatherium with a dense
fur and a coat thickness of 50 mm had the lowest lower
critical temperature among the four genera (-27° C) that is
equivalent to previous estimates for a densely furred Mylo-
don within its thermoneutral zone (Farifia, 2002), but lower
than lower critical temperature estimates of Eremotherium
with the same integument features applied herein (-18° C).
Dense fur conditions for Mylodon and Nothrotheriops with
coat thicknesses of 10-50 mm also have thermoneutral
zones that overlap with likely ambient temperature ranges
that each taxon would have experienced, as well as ambi-
ent temperatures well beyond the lowest estimates modeled
here (-12—24° C and —6~26.7° C, respectively). Consistent
trends of narrow thermoneutral zones resulting from sparse
fur (0.07-8.5 hairs/em?) with lower critical temperature

four taxa analyzed.

Microclimate simulations and integument thermal
tolerances

Similar outcomes favoring dense fur coverages were gener-
ally observed when multiple climatic variables, including
relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and ambient
temperature were input in the refined paleoclimate models.
Notably, Eremotherium was estimated to have no thermal
stress in all environments with dense, 10 mm fur insula-
tion (1,300-2,000 hairs/em?), but would have experienced
prominent cold stress in the northernmost range of its distri-
bution, although no thermal stress occurring in the southern-
most latitudes during the coldest months of the year in both
localities sampled (Fig. 6). This result contrasts with the
resolved trends that sparse fur coverage indicated in north-
ernmost and southernmost latitudes, which consistently
showed no thermal stress during only the warmest months
of the year. Dense 30-50 mm fur insulation for Eremoth-
erium was determined to be mostly detrimental by resulting

from metabolic chamber simulations with different fur densities and coat thicknesses

in overall heat stress, except for during the winter months in
only the northernmost latitudes and year-round in the south-
ernmost latitudes. Conversely, Eremotherium additionally
was modeled to have no thermal stress with sparse 50 mm
fur, but with more dense fur coverage resulting in constant
heat stress in neotropical regions (Fig. 6).

The refined paleoclimate models showed that Megath-
erium would have avoided thermal stress year-round with
full body, dense 30 mm fur insulation in all three of the
simulated environments, whereas full body, sparse fur (both
depths and densities) resulted in cold stress throughout the
year (Fig. 6). Both Mylodon and Nothrotheriops would also
have avoided any thermal stress with dense fur insulation
(density; 1,300-2,000 hairs/em?). In particular, Mylodon

was modeled to have no thermal stress with 10 mm fur dur-
ing the warmest months of the year and also with 30 mm
fur during the coldest months at northern and mid latitudes
(Fig. 6). Both Mylodon at the southernmost extent of its
range and Nothrotheriops across its entire geographic range
were determined to have no heat stress with dense fur with
a coat thickness of 50 mm.

as silhouettes are the body size analogues in order left-to-right: A fri-
can savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana; for Eremotherium), Asian
elephant (Elephas maximus; for Megatherium), Indian rhinoceros

Nothrotheriops showed a consistent maximum metabolic
activity value of 15 h day! throughout its geographic range
(Fig. 7). Comparative data on daily energetic expenditures
indicate that extant body size analogues of Eremotherium,
Megatherium, and Mylodon (e.g., African elephant, Indian
elephant, and Indian rhinoceros, respectively) all have val-
ues of 22 h day”! (Deka and Sarma 2015; Gravett et al.
2017) while that for much smaller Nothrotheriops, a brown
bear (Ursus arctos) analog, was measured at 20 h day"!
(Stelmock and Dean, 1986). In sum, all ground sloth taxa
were predicted to have 36.4-31.9% less metabolic activ-
ity than modern placental mammalian analogues of similar
body masses, but are far more active than extant tree sloths
(e.g., 3.48-6.48 h day !; Cliffe et al. 2023).

Monthly dietary intake

The estimated distributions of energy intake across all
four genera indicated no statistically significant trends in
monthly food consumption with a change in environment
(Fig. 8). While a general increase in food consumption was
demonstrated for the large-bodied megatheres, Eremoth-
erium was modeled to experience little-to-no increase in

(Rhinoceros unicornis; for Mylodon), brown bear (Ursus arctos; for
Nothrotheriops), Bradypus and Choloepus. Silhouettes were obtained
from PhyloPic.org (Michaud M, Taylor J, Keesey M, Morrow C, Jen-
kins X) and are under public domain (Total hours of activity for extant
analogues were based on daily hours of sleep reported in the literature

Cliffe et al. 2023)

food consumption (R?=0.009) throughout its wide geo-
graphic distribution. The genus Megatherium was modeled
to experience a moderate increase in monthly food intake in
the southernmost latitudes (R’=0.53), whereas the simula-
tions of Mylodon predicted a similar increase in food intake
in southern latitudes (R?=0.51), notably overlapping with
that of Megatherium. Finally, the data trends for Nothrothei-
rops showed a moderately strong decrease in monthly food
intake in the southern latitudes (R?=0.67) during the sum-
mer months.

Discussion

Geochemistry of fossil teeth and interpretations of
physiology

The similarities in clumped isotope temperatures from teeth
recovered from different locations, coupled with the low
REE index values, provides confidence that these estimates
may reflect the actual core body temperatures of extinct
ground sloths. These temperatures are notably lower than
the clumped isotope derived temperatures of other large

for an Indian elephant and extinct mammoths (Eagle et al.
2010), and ~34° C for a baleen whale (Griffiths et al. 2023).
Tooth material from ground sloth specimens showing little
diagenetic alteration were obtained from three different dep-
ositional environments and produced temperature estimates
within the range of extant xenarthran body temperatures.
Given that the estimates for Nothrotheriops were derived
from a single tooth sample with a relatively high REE ratio
(0.86), some degree of caution should be given to the inter-
pretation of the results from this specimen. Measurements
obtained from the Eremotherium sample UF 312730 yield
higher values in both A47 and A48 which could indicate con-
tamination of the samples resulting in isobaric interference
and a subsequent overestimation of A47 and unrealistically
cold A47 derived temperatures (Fig. 1c). This aside, these
novel data suggest that extinct ground sloths may have been
heterothermic, and likely fluctuated their core body temper-
atures as a main means of thermoregulation. The core body
temperature estimates derived from the clumped isotope
analyses are indeed within the range of error of known body
temperatures for extant xenarthrans (30.2—36.6° C), further
verifying body temperature values determined for the Niche
Mapper simulations and suggesting that the observed ubiq-
uitous similarities in thermophysiology are an ancestral trait
in this clade.

Clumped isotope estimates of body temperature, how-
ever, are on the lower end of Niche Mapper simulations for
the mean estimate of 29+2° C determined for UF 95869.
This could be explained by the measurements taken from
specific tooth loci reflecting potential periods of torpor akin
to what has been proposed for troodontids (Tagliaventoor et
al. 2023), estimates from teeth might may also reflect slight
differences in core body temperature and the temperature
of tooth mineralization as has been explored in interpreting
clumped isotope values derived from regionally endother-
mic sharks (Griffiths et al. 2023). These hypotheses should
be explored in future analyses focusing on taking samples
from specific regions of internal orthodentine to determine
if core body temperatures were fluctuating throughout the
life of the animals. Such methods were previously applied
to teeth from Eremotherium to infer the environmental con-
ditions during the life of a single individual, specifically
using 8'°C and 5!8O measurements (Larmon et al. 2019).
Analyses of more specimens spanning a broader range of
climate conditions similar to the approaches that have been
used on non-avian dinosaur remains (Fricke and Rodgers
2000; Amoit et al. 2006) may also be informative. Never-
theless, the clumped isotope measurements along with the
results of the physiological modeling analyses herein col-
lectively indicate that extinct ground sloths had lower body
temperatures and basal metabolic rates than most large ter-
restrial placental mammals.

Comparisons with previous analyses

The low body temperature estimates obtained from fossil
ground sloth teeth suggest lower metabolic rates akin to
extant xenarthrans and contradict the higher values of meta-
bolic rates based on estimated blood flow rate (Varela et al.
2024). Varela et al. (2024) hypothesized that small nutrient
foramen diameters of the femur, and thus restricted blood
flow rates, along with the fossorial and arboreal habits of
extant xenarthrans all correlated with low metabolic rates.
However, raw data from that study shows overlap between
femoral nutrient foramen diameters and blood flow rates of
extant xenarthrans and placental mammals with elevated
metabolic rates. For example, the nutrient foramina of both
the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and the leop-
ard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) have a measured diameter of
0.9 mm despite their extremely different functional habits
and ecology. Given these types of discrepancies in their
analysis, we caution that using measured nutrient foramen
diameter alone is not a reliable predictor of metabolic rate,
and it could likely reflect an artifact of similar body size. The
core body temperature estimates obtained from the estab-
lished clumped isotope analyses used herein potentially
offer a more direct estimation of core body temperature and
expand our understanding of the physiological limitations
potentially experienced by extinct ground sloths.

The paleoclimate simulations also yielded metabolic rate
values drastically different values from those of the Farifia
(2002) study on ground sloth thermal energetics. In addi-
tion to refined estimates of clade specific basal metabolic
rates for ground sloths, numerous other environmental fac-
tors beyond ambient temperatures were input and modeled
across the geographic distributions of each genus to deter-
mine more exact boundaries of thermal neutrality. The basal
metabolic rate estimates derived from the xenarthran scal-
ing equation (White and Seymour 2004) produced meta-
bolic rates representing only 34-41% of those for mammals
with typical placental metabolism as determined by the
relationship of Kleiber (1932) (Farifia 2002). Substantially
lower basal metabolic rates were predicted in the present
study, thus producing markedly different results for thermal
tolerance ranges across the various integument conditions
tested compared with those already reported. The main pre-
vious study (Farifia 2002) proposed that a sparsely furred
Megatherium with a body mass of 4,000 kg and metabolism
that was 50% that of a typical placental mammal would be
within its thermoneutral zone at ambient temperatures of
10° C versus the results from the present climate simula-
tions, which suggest that Megatherium under similar condi-
tions would have been cold stressed.

Traditional determinations of thermoneutral zones
using the xenarthran metabolism as a proxy suggest

Page 15 of 24 1

Eremotherium and Megatherium with dense fur and a coat
depth of 10 mm would be akin to those of sparsely furred
models (see Fig. 5). However, the microclimate models
employed herein demonstrated that environmental factors
aside from ambient temperature (i.e., relative humidity,
wind speed, etc.) and metabolic activity (i.e., locomotion,
foraging, etc.) accounted for the predicted outcome that
dense 10 mm thicknesses would benefit Eremotherium only
during the warmest months of the year at its northernmost
and southernmost ranges year-round. The novel microcli-
mate models also showed that having dense fur at a coat
thickness of 10 mm would result in constant heat stress for
Eremotherium in the neotropics, yet constant cold stress
for Megatherium throughout its geographic distribution
(Fig. 6). Despite heat stress modeled to be present in the
tropical populations of Eremotherium having a full body fur
coverage at a depth of 30-50 mm, the condition of dense
10 mm fur depths would allow it to exhibit no intense ther-
mal stress year-round, even during the hottest months of
the year throughout its entire geographic range. The find-
ings for southernmost region for Mylodon and those data
for Nothrotheriops throughout its entire range with dense
50 mm fur depths, suggest nearly complete yearly protec-
tion from thermal stress in their respective environments,
with mild cold stress for the three coldest months of the year
(predicted temperatures; -3.26—0.9° C). These results also
contrast with previous estimates (Farifia 2002) that thermal
neutrality for Mylodon having a basal metabolic rate half of
the typical placental metabolism and dense fur 40 mm deep
would be at an ambient temperature of -28° C.

Megathere thermal neutrality and geographic
distribution

The data from the paleoclimate analyses revealed criti-
cal insight into the thermoregulatory thresholds of extinct
ground sloths and how these would have impacted their life
appearance by condition of their integument. In particular,
the results for Eremotherium suggest that a wide range of
integument models could be plausible depending on ambi-
ent temperatures of their past environments. Given that
Eremotherium had a geographic distribution spanning as far
north as Virginia in North America and as far south as Brazil
in South America, it is plausible that this genus had vary-
ing degrees of fur coverage throughout its geographic range.
Sparse, full body fur coverage would have been beneficial at
mid-ranges with no thermal stress experienced year-round.
Changes in fur depth would also have been beneficial dur-
ing warmer months for Eremotherium at the most northern
extent of its range, although there is no evidence of coat
shedding in extant xenarthrans. Nonetheless, dense 10 mm
fur could have prevented thermal stress at average ambient

base map was generated using QGIS3’s ‘World Map’; hand-drawn ice
sheet overlay informed and modified after published data (Ehlers and

temperature ranges of 5.9-22.6° C that Eremotherium was
expected to have experienced (Fig. 6). Moreover, because
Eremotherium crossed the Isthmus of Panama into North
America but subsequently retreated to South America during
the last glacial maximum (McDonald and Lundelius 2009) it
is possible for it to have undergone migrations during times
of extreme seasonality. Due to the modeled presence of mild
cold stress with dense 10 mm fur and no thermal neutrality
with a 50 mm fur depth in the southernmost ranges, it is
therefore suggested that Eremotherium was well-adapted to
the neotropical conditions expected to be prevalent in the

southernmost extent of its range (Fig. 9a). This hypothesis
notably agrees with the absence of Eremotherium in North
America during the last glacial maximum.

Despite being similar in body size to Eremotherium, the
genus Megatherium is expected to have exhibited constant
cold stress with only sparse fur coverage throughout its
geographic range. This can be explained by Megatherium
being known to have inhabited cooler, dry environments in
the pampas of Argentina and Chile. Using similar modeling
approaches to physiology as presented herein, previous sen-
sitivity analyses (Lovelace et al. 2020) revealed that ambient

Journal of Mammalian Evolution (2025) 32:1

temperature and wind speed values were the two climatic
factors that most strongly influence predicted values of field
metabolic rate, whereas the variables of relative humidity
and cloud coverage had little effect on simulated metabo-
lism. Thus, dense fur for Megatherium might have been
needed to counteract greater exposure to the elements (e.g.,
wind, rain, or snow) in more open environments (Fig. 9c).
This integument condition is reflected in the present climate
simulation results which indicate that with a full body cov-
erage of fur at depths of 10 mm, Megatherium would have
been constantly cold-stressed regardless of fur density, but
it would have complete thermal neutrality in all latitudinal
distributions with dense (1,300—2,000 hairs/cm?) fur with a
coat depth of 30 mm. Conversely, by having dense 50 mm
fur, Megatherium would have been constantly heat-stressed
by over insulation (Fig. 6). Furthermore, considering that
fur depths of 30-50 mm resulted in predicted heat stress
for similarly-sized Eremotherium (with the exception of the
coldest months at northern extents of its range), it is reason-
able to speculate that neotropical conditions may have acted
as a thermal gradient restricting Megatherium to southern
latitudes and occupation of the westernmost regions of Peru
and Ecuador (Fig. 9a; Pujos and Salas 2004). This hypoth-
esis is supported by models of environmental distributions
of various Pleistocene xenarthrans by Varela et al. (2018)
which demonstrate little-to-no overlap between the geo-
graphic ranges of Eremotherium and Megatherium suggest-
ing distinct differences in habitat preference.

Thermoregulation in Mylodon and Nothrotheriops

Both Mylodon and Nothrotheriops were modeled to require
dense 10-50 mm fur depths across their respective ranges
of predicted ambient temperature exposure, which is
directly observed in the preserved pelts from both genera
(Ridgewood 1901; Hausman 1929). Nevertheless, given
that Mylodon was known to inhabit the Andes Mountains
in South America, and Nothrotheriops would have experi-
enced paleoclimate temperatures as low as -3.3° C (Fig. 3),
behavioral thermoregulation would have been expected
in cold climates in addition to having thick fur coverage.
One supposition is that thermal neutrality could have been
maintained by taking shelter in caves during periods of ther-
mal stress. Mean annual temperature estimates of caves in
the American southwest where remains of Nothrotheriops
have been documented reveal stable temperature ranges that
would have provided protection against periods of thermal
stress (6.6—17° C; McDonald 2022; Fig. 9b). Localities for
Mylodon in Chile such as Chica cave exhibit a similar range
of stable temperatures (4.83—17.4° C; Nehme et al. 2022).
A second hypothesis is that both taxa may have undergone

Page 17 of 24 1

periods of torpor and/or hibernation as a behavioral means
of cold tolerance.

Isotopic and taphonomic studies on the extinct Patago-
nian ‘panther’ (Panthera onca mesembrina) revealed that
bite marks attributed to this extinct predator have been found
on the bones of juvenile and adult individuals of Mylodon
in Cueva del Milod6n (Prevosti and Martin 2013; Martin
2018). While Mylodon was smaller than the megatheres, an
adult individual was still much larger than a jaguar, which
suggests that individuals found with bite marks in caves
were preyed upon while they were undergoing torpor, when
they would have been most vulnerable to attack. Additional
support for the above hypotheses proposed herein can also
be linked to the behavioral thermoregulation strategies
observed in modern armadillos. For example, the nine-
banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) is known to seek
shelter during periods of extreme cold and employ a combi-
nation of torpor with episodic foraging (McBee and Baker
1982; Knight et al. 2020). Regular torpor also has been doc-
umented in the pichi armadillo (Zaedyus pichiy) (Superina
and Boily 2007; Superina and Abba 2014), and it is the only
known extant xenarthran to undergo true hibernation.

It is also possible that Mylodon and Nothrotheriops may
have had higher activity levels than those estimated in the
present analysis. However, higher metabolic demands in the
smaller ground sloths would only be useful in temperatures
well below the range of ambient temperatures predicted
for both taxa. Accordingly, another potential explanation
for their thermal energetics involves having a diet richer in
energy than their megathere conspecifics. A recent analysis
of amino acids (Tejada et al. 2021) suggested that the diet
of Mylodon could have consisted of animal protein due to
the nitrogen signatures found in their fossilized bone mate-
rial. Though the exact timings of nitrogen signatures indica-
tive of omnivory could not be determined, animal protein
consumption would have had thermoregulatory benefits for
Mylodon. A protein-rich diet provides some flexibility to
thermal neutrality in cold climates, and it is possible that
Mylodon consumed animal matter sporadically during the
coldest months, in addition to foraging on grasses (Varela
et al. 2023). Conversely, nitrogen isotopes recovered from
Nothrotheriops fossil remains definitively did not show evi-
dence for an omnivorous diet, but instead, this genus was
eating carbohydrate-rich desert plants such as globemallow
and casava root (Poinar et al. 1998).

Mylodontids also possessed dermal ossicles of vary-
ing shapes and sizes which may have provided protection
against predators (Collins 1933; McDonald 2018; Toledo et
al. 2021). Given the vascularized nature of these structures
in ground sloths as a whole, Cartelle and Bohérquez (1986)
hypothesized that the dermal ossicles may have played a role
in thermoregulation as well. Yet, histological examinations

ay Springer

of Mylodon ossicles by Toledo et al. (2021) show no fea-
tures indicating the storage of adipose tissue akin to those
in extant armadillos (Krmpotic et al. 2009). While measure-
ments of the thermal conductance have yet to be performed,
Toledo et al. (2021) implied that the fur of mylodontids such
as Mylodon would have provided a greater amount of insu-
lation compared to vascularized osteoderms.

Integument and behavioral factors

Giant ground sloths have historically been reconstructed as
being densely furred taxa and the novel data provided by the
Niche Mapper simulations do little to challenge this integu-
ment appearance. In contrast, the modeling results dis-
agree with more sparsely furred, elephant-like integument
reconstructions of Eremotherium and Megatherium (Farifia
2002). Despite the obvious discrepancies between studies
on thermal neutrality and its effects on ground sloth integu-
ment, several critical behavioral and ecological preferences
can now be inferred. For example, dental microstructure
and microware patterns (Green and Kalthoff 2015), in addi-
tion to isotopic analyses (Dantas et al. 2021), suggest a
completely herbivorous diet for Eremotherium and Megath-
erium despite previous speculation that they were possibly
omnivorous and/or engaged in scavenging behavior (Farifia
and Blanco 1996). Indeed, the diets of both taxa would have
primarily consisted of leaves and other high-growing veg-
etation (Bargo et al. 2006; Green and Kalthoff 2015; Boche-
rens et al. 2017), which overlap with those of their closest
extant relatives Bradypus spp. (Cliffe et al. 2015; Pauli et al.
2016; Preslee et al. 2019; Delsuc et al. 2019; Tejada et al.
2024). Leaves are poor in nutritional value correlating with
the extremely low metabolic rates observed in Bradypus
variegatus (Cliffe et al. 2015; Pauli et al. 2016) and may be
a primary factor for why megatheres would have had low
metabolic rates for mammals of their massive body size.
One of the main outcomes of our is that megatheres
are predicted to have a basal metabolic rate more similar
to modern xenarthrans than other placental mammals. Yet,
they also could have exhibited a number of behaviors similar
to large extant mammals with the typical placental metab-
olism. Notably, the bone bed of Eremotherium at Tanque
Loma in southwest Ecuador was found to contain multiple
individuals that died in a stagnant marsh or swamp. The
assemblage was interpreted as evidence of herding behavior
in megatheres (Lindsey et al. 2020). It was further suggested
that Eremotherium engaged in wallowing behavior for ther-
moregulatory purposes akin to that observed in a modern
hippopotamus (Stears et al. 2018). The modeled variation
in both the density and depth of fur across the geographic
range of Eremotherium is arguably more broadly correlated
with a similar thermoregulatory strategy. Large migratory

Journal of Mammalian Evolution (2025) 32:1

ungulates such as the American bison (Bison bison) shed
their dense winter coat to a lighter, patchy coat that coin-
cides with wallowing behavior (McMillan et al. 2000).
Large Megatherium also could have engaged in wallowing
but would not have required shedding due to its year-round
thermal neutrality when having a dense, deep 30 mm fur
coat (Figs. 5 and 6).

Social behavior dynamics of the extinct megatheres and
large mylodonts (e.g., Lestodon) are further proposed to
be consistent with those observed in large extant placental
mammals (Tomassini et al. 2020; Lindsey et al. 2020), yet
differ greatly from the solitary lifestyles of extant tree sloths
(Taube et al. 1999). One advantage to more complex social
behavior could have been shared parental care (also inferred
from the bonebed of Eremotherium at Tonque Loma; Lind-
sey et al. 2020) with multiple adults protecting juveniles that
are most susceptible to predation. Conversely, a sole female
Bradypus spp. raises her single offspring, and if it falls from
the tree during lactation/weaning, then she does not invest
the metabolic energy to retrieve it (Taube et al. 1999).

Again, the present findings predict densely furred integu-
ment for Mylodon and Nothrotheriops as demonstrated by
their mummified pelts (Ridgewood 1901; Hausman 1929).
Given that there is a lack of fossil bonebeds consisting of
multiple individuals, it is suggested that both genera poten-
tially lived solitary lifestyles similar to extant tree sloths
and armadillos (Naples et al. 1990). Mylodontids also pos-
sess robust limb bones that were resistant to bending forces
akin to extant armadillos (Copploe et al. 2015), suggesting
that some genera were capable of digging their own dens
or burrows (Bargo et al. 2000). Solitary denning behavior
as seen in modern brown bears (Gonzalez-Bernardo et al.
2020), a body size analog of both smaller ground sloth taxa,
also may have been typical of Mylodon and Nothrotheriops
in cave dwellings. Moreover, an ecological preference that
could have overlapped with ursids is diet. A modern species
of two-toed sloth, Choloepus hoffmanni, is a close relative
to Mylodon (Preslee etc. al. 2019; Delsuc et al. 2019; Tejada
et al. 2024), and has been known to occasionally consume
meat in captivity (Hayssen 2011). Species of the genus Cho-
loepus are also more active compared to Bradypus variega-
tus (Sunquist and Montgomery 1973), which specializes in
a diet of leaves presumably akin to its megathere relatives.

Last, while it is tempting to focus on phylogenetic con-
straint as the singular reason for the predicted low basal
metabolic rates of extinct ground sloths, it should be noted
that traits can be secondarily lost or acquired throughout
the evolutionary history of a clade. Prior to GABI, the very
large herbivore guild of South America was dominated by
notoungulates and astrapotheres that were mixed grazers
and browsers that went extinct by the end of the Miocene
prior to the earliest occurrences of the exceptionally large

Journal of Mammalian Evolution (2025) 32:1

megatherines such as Eremotherium and Megatherium
(Croft et al. 2020). The largest of the notoungulates were
members of the families Toxodontidae, Leontiniidae, and
Homalodotheriidae. While toxodontids and macraucheni-
ids lived alongside megatherines through the late Pleisto-
cene (and reached body masses of 1,000—1,200 kg; Croft
et al. 2020; Nelson et al. 2023), astraoptheres, leontinids,
and homalodotheres ranging in body masses from 375 to
3,000 kg (Croft et al. 2020; Nelson et al. 2023) went extinct
by the end of the middle to late Miocene. By contrast, most
South American Miocene ground sloth genera were much
smaller in size compared to contemporary notoungulates
and astrapotheres, and larger ground sloths that would
evolve in the Pliocene and Pleistocene (6— 1,025 kg; Pant et
al. 2014: table s1). A lower metabolic rate in ground sloths
would have reduced resource demands and potentially lim-
ited competition with notoungulates and astrapotheres. This
in turn could be understood as an “ecological stepping-
stone” towards occupying the vacant browser niche with-
out requiring as many calories as a similarly-sized mammal
with a typical placental metabolism. The observed trends in
daily food intake in Eremotherium and Megatherium sup-
port this notion by suggesting little change in the amount
of food consumed across their various geographic regions
(Fig. 7). This major ecological factor also could have lim-
ited intraspecific competition for resources in megatheres,
but notably reduced the pressure of interspecific competi-
tion with herds of proboscideans (e.g., mammoths and mast-
odons) with much greater energetic demands that entered
South America following GABI.

Limitations

While use of REE index values in the present study pro-
duced values within acceptable limits as reported by Mac-
Fadden et al. (2010), there are inconsistencies between
this method and the phosphate 5!8O data. Namely, FANH
P14511 has an abnormally high REE index of 36.6 and
acceptable phosphate 5!8O measurements within the range
of extant placental mammals. The REE index is the first
technique used to assess the degree of diagenesis in fossil
xenarthran teeth, and this method has yet to be tested on
specimens outside of the Pliocene and Pleistocene locali-
ties of Florida. The high REE concentration in the inner
orthodentine of FMNH P14511 could be explained by it
being found in older Miocene deposits, although this is
inconsistent with the phosphate 5'°O measurements which
indicate that it is well-preserved. Moreover, a specimen of
Bradypus (UF 25980) reported in the supplementary mate-
rials of MacFadden et al. (2010) has a dentine/bone index
value of 30.6, which is comparable to the index value of
FMNH P 14511. That said, the criteria set by MacFadden et

Page 19 of 24 1

al. (2010) of acceptable REE index values>0.35 are based
on measurements of enamel-bearing mammals from the
same localities as fossil xenarthrans rather than from mod-
ern bone, dentine, and enamel. We were unable to procure
enamel samples from non-xenarthran placental mammals
from the same localities, which would have aided in deter-
mining the relative degree of diagenesis in the ground sloth
teeth used in this study. Clumped isotope temperatures are
also based on CO; being substituted into the PO, and OH
sites of hydroxylapatite, while REE concentrations occur
on the Ca?" site of hydroxylapatite (Kohn et al. 1999), sug-
gesting that geochemical alteration may not be the same at
either bonding site. Based on these factors, and the REE
index not accounting for the carbonate contamination of UF
312730 (Fig. 1c; Online Resource 2), we argue that use of
the REE index alone does not always provide a robust indi-
cator of diagenesis or lack thereof.

Suarez and Passey (2014) showed that clumped iso-
tope temperatures found in fossil bone can be intermediate
between ambient temperatures during the time of fossiliza-
tion and body temperature. However, predominantly bone
was used in their analysis, which is more prone to diage-
netic alteration compared to dental tissues such as enamel
and dentine (MacFadden et al. 2010). Their dataset also did
not include internal orthodentine from fossil xenarthrans,
which is less prone to diagenesis than external dentine but
not as resistant as enamel. Cathodoluminescence performed
by Larmon et al. (2019) demonstrated that internal ortho-
dentine in an Eremotherium tooth exhibits very few cracks
where mineral impregnation can occur and they concluded
that little diagenesis had occurred. Moreover, Suarez and
Passey (2014) did not compare phosphate concentrations of
their samples compared to extant mammalian bone, whereas
our previous studies (Eagle et al. 2010, 2011) have shown
that the temperatures obtained from the teeth of extinct ver-
tebrates using clumped isotope mass spectrometry reflect
the core body temperature of the organism, and not an inter-
mediate between the body temperature and the temperature
of the environment.

The novel data generated herein offer several intrigu-
ing implications for ground sloth integument, thermal
energetics, ecology, and behavior. However, it is acknowl-
edged that the results may not be definitive. The presence
of low body temperatures determined by clumped isotope
paleothermometry is suggestive that ground sloths were
heterothermic, akin to their closest living relatives. How-
ever, further analyses with a larger sample size consisting
of specimens from various depositional environments are
needed to verify this hypothesis. Given that some of the cor-
tical bone samples did not come from the same individuals
as the respective tooth samples, this could impact the values
of REE ratios due to potential differences in REE uptake

during fossilization. While samples were taken from other
sections of the fossil teeth used for the geochemical analy-
ses, these were not used due to restrictions of time and fund-
ing for this study. Further analyses of these samples could
better indicate evidence of a past heterothermic condition as
the inner orthodentine could have recorded different isoto-
pic signals, and thus different body temperature estimates.

The modeling simulations presented here assumed con-
sistent fur depth and density across the entire body, whereas
these parameters can vary about the body surface area and
this factor should be taken into account when considering
the full implications of the results. Other factors such as skin
thickness, hair shaft thickness, underfur, and the presence/
absence of hollow hair shafts should additionally be taken
into account with future analyses. Admittedly, we tested
only average adult body masses, and our results could vary
if tested while accounting for intraspecific variations in body
masses. Pliocene climates were excluded from this analysis
due to Pleistocene climate variables being easier to use for
extrapolation of reasonable monthly values from modern
climate data. The inclusion of Pliocene Epoch climate data
would give more insight into how integument and associ-
ated fur coverage could have varied in earlier populations of
both Eremotherium and Megatherium. Lastly, geologic ages
of localities sampled for the microclimate simulations cover
a broad range of geologic time encompassing the entire span
of the Pleistocene from 2,500,000-11,500 years ago, and
more precise dates were not available in the Paleobiology
Database (Online Resource 1). More precise estimates of
paleoclimate and dating of ground sloth localities could
have greatly improved the microclimate simulations.

Conclusions

Clumped isotope palaeothermometry of inner orthoden-
tine provides convincing evidence for extinct ground sloths
having body temperatures akin to extant xenarthrans and
potentially being heterothermic, regardless of absolute dif-
ferences in body sizes. These findings combined with novel
biophysical modeling results in Niche Mapper demonstrate
that lower body temperatures and basal metabolisms, in
addition to environmental variables, impacted ground sloth
geographical distribution, thermoregulation ability, and
integument form. The “hairless model of integument” pre-
viously proposed for Megatherium is untenable when more
accurate estimates of xenarthran basal metabolism, while
the closely related Eremotherium has been suggested to be
sparsely furred in neotropical climates. Giant ground sloths
likely had a variety of integument appearances from dense,
thinner fur coverage in the neotropics to dense, thicker fur
coverage in cold environments. Smaller ground sloths would

ay Springer

Journal of Mammalian Evolution (2025) 32:1

have needed dense, thick fur supplemented with behavioral
thermoregulation to endure cold climates throughout the
year. The modeling data also point to surprising adaptabil-
ity of xenarthran physiology in both the largest and smaller
ground sloths. Moreover, the predicted integument models
for the largest taxa are believed to be reliable unless refuted
by a future specimen with extensive preserved integument.
Prospective future models must examine other taxa (e.g.,
Megalonyx, Thalassocnus, Lestodon, etc.) and include his-
tological studies to help determine how low the basal meta-
bolic rates of ground sloths could have been beneficial,
therefore providing further insight into the physiology of
these and other fossil xenarthrans and how their metabolic
rates impacted their integument appearance, growth rates,
ecology, and behavior.
