Abstract

Background: Simple biometrics such as peak heart rate and exercise duration remain core
predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Commercial wearable devices track physical and
cardiac electrical activity. Detailed, longitudinal data collection from wearables presents a valuable

opportunity to identify new factors associated with CVD.

Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed 6,947 participants in the Fitbit Bring-Your-Own-
Device Project, a subset of the All of Us Research Program. The primary exposure Daily Heart
Rate Per Step (DHRPS) was defined as the average daily heart rate divided by steps per day. Our
analysis correlated DHRPS with established CVD factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke,
heart failure, coronary atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction) as primary outcomes. We also
performed a DHRPS-based phenome-wide association study (Phe WAS) on the spectrum of human
disease traits for all 1,789 disease codes across 17 disease categories. Secondary outcomes
included maximum metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved on cardiovascular treadmill exercise
stress testing.

Results: We examined 5.8 million person-days and 51 billion total steps of individual-level Fitbit

data paired with electronic health record data. Elevated DHRPS was associated with type 2

diabetes (OR 2.03 [95% CI 1.70-2.42]), hypertension (OR 1.63 [95% CI 1.32-2.02]), heart failure
(OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.00-3.14]), and coronary atherosclerosis (OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.14-1.82]), even
after adjusting for daily heart rate and step count. DHRPS also had stronger correlations with max
METs achieved on exercise stress testing compared to steps per day (Ap=0.04, p<0.001) and heart
rate (Ap=0.31, p<0.001). Lastly, DHRPS-based PheWAS demonstrated stronger associations with

CVD factors (p<1x10>) compared to daily heart rate or step count.

Conclusions: In the All of Us Research Program Fitbit Bring- Your-Own-Device Project, DHRPS
was an easy-to-calculate wearables metric and was more strongly associated with cardiovascular

fitness and CVD outcomes than daily heart rate and step count.

Introduction

Wearable devices, such as the Fitbit and Apple Watch, are widely used to monitor and track
physical activity and cardiac metrics!*. Consumer devices have become increasingly popular for
their ability to provide real-time feedback on health-related behaviors’. These features have raised
public awareness about the importance of physical activity; however, the mechanisms underlying
the relationship between daily steps and cardiovascular health remain unclear. Specifically, daily
step count reflects motor activity driven by conscious effort, serving as a proxy for exercise
duration and an indirect measure of exercise capacity. Understanding these relationships are

essential for improving how wearable data can be used to assess and manage cardiovascular health.

Cardiac stress tests directly evaluate the heart’s response to external stress in a controlled clinical
environment*. Low cardiorespiratory fitness on a cardiac stress test predicts increased CVD
incidence and mortality’. Previous studies have advocated for more widespread use of exercise
capacity in clinical medicine given the strong correlations between cardiovascular and all-cause
mortality®°. However, adherence to prescriptions for outpatient cardiac stress tests in the U.S. has
been less than 60%!" In contrast, consumers spend money to manage their well-being with Fitbit
devices, which track physical activity, heart rate, sleep patterns, and other health metrics. Wearable
devices have been voluntarily adopted by the public, and the availability of granular data from
wearable devices on the scale of minutes and hours presents an opportunity to identify new
biomarkers associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD), potentially improving on

the rough estimate of step count, and with better compliance than intermittent cardiac stress tests!.

The purpose of this study was to use a cross-sectional dataset to examine the association between
Daily Heart Rate Per Step (DHRPS) and CVD, then to compare these to previously-studied metrics
like average daily heart rate and step count!*"!>. In total, we analyzed individual-level Fitbit device
data paired with electronic health records (EHR) through the All of Us Research Program Fitbit
Bring-Your-Own-Device Project. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that an elevated
DHRPS could be associated with increased CVD prevalence'*'’. This new wearable biomarker
could potentially provide better individual stratification for CVD as an effective, low-cost, high-

compliance screening tool.

Methods

The All of Us Research Program is a comprehensive health data repository supported by the
National Institutes of Health. Details of the All of Us recruitment methods have been described
separately!*. Briefly, health provider organizations and community partners recruited participants,
with more than 75% of participants from groups historically underrepresented in biomedical
research. All of Us gathered self-reported surveys, physical measurements, and encoded electronic
health records, with ethics approval from the All of Us IRB to ensure ethical compliance in

recruitment, data collection, and utilization.

The data is available in the All of Us Research Program public repository, accessible after
completing the required training (https://workbench researchallofus.org/). Informed consent was
obtained from each participant by the All of Us _ Research Program

(https://allofus nih.gov/article/all-us-consent-process).

Study Design and Eligibility Criteria

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

Data from the All of Us version 7 (C2022Q4R9 CDR) Fitbit Bring- Your-Own-Device Project was
used to establish a cross-sectional, observational study population with recruitment dates from
summer 2017 to July 1*, 2022. The study utilizes wearable data to derive metrics that serve as
exposures, linking them to modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, type 2
diabetes) and specific major adverse cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke).
The primary cohort included participants with a minimum of 10 days of Fitbit device data,
excluding individuals missing data on age, sex at birth, BMI, enrollment survey responses, or
EHR-linkage. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was conducted on participants with Fitbit data
and cardiovascular treadmill exercise testing to compare wearable-derived metrics with

established clinical measures of cardiovascular fitness.

Wearable Data Sampling and Exposure Variables

Wearable data included minute-by-minute physical activity and heart rate measurements. The data
were obtained from participants with a minimum of 10 days of recording, with most extending
beyond this period; however, the wearable data were retrospective and cross-sectional in nature.
For each participant, average daily heart rate was calculated by averaging the heart rate across all
minutes in a day (midnight-to-midnight). Steps per day were also counted. A derived metric,
DHRPS (daily heart rate per step), was calculated by dividing daily heart rate by steps per day for
each available day, then averaging across all days with data. Three wearable-derived metrics were

analyzed as exposures: daily heart rate, steps per day, and DHRPS.

Outcomes of Interest

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

Disease phecodes were mapped from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM billing codes!*. We tested
associations of our exposure variable (DHRPS) against two types of outcome variables. The first
was the prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension (401.1), type 2 diabetes
(250.2), and coronary atherosclerosis (411.4). The second was a subset of major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACEs): myocardial infarction (411.2), stroke (433.3), and heart failure
(428.2). The cross-sectional data structure implies that relationships between exposure and

outcome variables establish associations, not causality.

Data Analysis

Primary Analysis

To evaluate the clinical association between DHRPS and CVD, a baseline model was constructed
using six logistic regressions. These regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for the association between DHRPS and each of the six primary
outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI. We then created an adjusted multivariate
model to demonstrate the incremental discriminative value of DHRPS beyond existing wearable-
derived metrics. The adjusted model included the same six logistic regressions, but with two
additional independent variables—steps per day and daily heart rate—added to the baseline
independent variables. The change in odds ratios before and after adjusting for these metrics
quantified the incremental discriminative information contributed by DHRPS. The prevalence
ratio (PR) was calculated by dividing the prevalence of a condition in the exposed group by its

prevalence in the unexposed group, with a corresponding 95% CI.

Additionally, the C-index was used to assess the improvement in model discrimination provided

by including DHRPS. Two models were constructed for this purpose: Model | included age, sex,

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

race/ethnicity, BMI, steps per day, and daily heart rate. Model 2 incorporated the same variables
as Model | along with DHRPS. The 95% confidence intervals for each C-index were calculated
using bootstrapping with 10,000 resamples, and the incremental improvements in discrimination
between the two models were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test across the bootstrapped

samples.

PheWAS Analysis

For the Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), multivariate regression models were
constructed to estimate the associations between wearable-derived factors versus all 1,789 disease
phecodes across 17 disease categories while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI. To
prevent false positives due to one-time miscoding, a case was counted if a participant had been
coded for the same phecode in two or more encounters, occuring on separate dates, according to
standard methodology”’. Multiple testing was adjusted with Bonferroni correction. The z-score

and p-value of the regression coefficient for wearable-derived factors were used for comparison.

Subgroup Analyses

For the subgroup of participants with exercise stress test data available, we used Spearman’s rank
correlation to correlate wearable-derived factors with maximum metabolic equivalents (METs)
achieved. The difference in correlation values (DHRPS vs. steps per day, DHRPS vs. heart rate)
were compared using Wilcoxon signed-ranked test on 10,000 bootstrapped samples drawn with
replacement. As a participant-reported measure, we also examined the correlation between
wearable-derived factors and self-reported physical health quality from the All of Us enrollment
health survey. Likert-based self-reported physical health (1 “Poor” through 5 “Excellent”) was

extracted from the survey question “In general, how would you rate your physical health?”

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

The participants were also divided into three groups based on DHRPS quartiles: low quartile (<25
percentile or raw DHRPS value <0.0081), medium group (>25 percentile and <75 percentile), high
quartile (275 percentile or raw DHRPS value 20.0147). Polynomial regression was used to
estimate potentially non-linear central tendency and uncertainty of CVD as it pertains to age as a
continuous variable. According to our hypothesis, a high DHRPS value should be associated with
elevated disease associations, having a higher ratio of average heart rate over lower number of
steps. In contrast, a lower DHRPS should be associated with decreased disease associations, with
the cardioprotective effects from a lower average heart rate over higher number of steps. After
dividing participants into three DHRPS groups (low, medium, high), a second order polynomial
regression model estimated the effects of each DHRPS group on primary outcome associations
across the age spectrum, with the goal of uncovering curvilinear relationships that may exist and

shedding light on critical age thresholds in CVD associations.

All analyses were performed on the All of Us Research Workbench in Python using the statsmodels

package.

Results

A total of 6,947 individuals (mean [+SD] age, 54.6 [+15.1] years) were included in analysis,
including 5.8 million person-days and 50 billion total steps of individual-level Fitbit device data.
The median number of days with Fitbit data available was 795 days (IQR 365-1342), ranging from

10 to 2710 days. The characteristics of the participants in each group are shown in Table 1.

High DHRPS was associated with increased prevalence of CVD

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

Overall, participants in the high DHRPS quartile group experienced at least a 34% increase in the
prevalence ratio for all six primary outcomes compared to the medium DHRPS group (Table 2
p<0.001 for each among type II diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, coronary
atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction). Further, the high DHRPS quartile, with a high ratio of
daily heart rate to steps, was associated with at least a 56% increase in the prevalence ratio for all
six primary outcomes compared to the low DHRPS quartile, a larger disparity compared to the

medium DHRPS group.

High DHRPS values were also associated with individual risk factors in multivariate regression.
When including DHRPS in statistical models with both modifiable clinical risk factors and
MACEs, multivariate logistic regression showed that higher DHRPS values (achieved through
increasing of daily heart rate, decreasing of steps per day, or a combination of both) were
associated with >40% increases in odds for all primary outcomes (p<0.001) while controlling for
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI (Figure 1). To ensure that DHRPS has discriminative value
above the isolated wearable data components of steps per day and daily heart rate, we evaluated
DHRPS in an additional multivariable model which included steps per day and average heart rate
as co-variates. In this model, DHRPS was still associated with a statistically significant increased
OR in type 2 diabetes (OR 2.03 [95% CI 1.70-2.42] p<0.001), hypertension (OR 1.63 [95% CI
1.32-2.02] p<0.001), heart failure (OR 1.77 [95% CI 1.00-3.14] p=0.05), and coronary
atherosclerosis (OR 1.44 [95% CI 1.14-1.82] p<0.001). As further evidence that DHRPS provides
incremental discriminative value, we calculated the C-index for the two sets of logistic regression
models established above. Compared to Model 1 with demographic and wearable factors,

incorporating DHRPS in Model 2 showed a statistically significant increase in the C-index for

primary outcomes, indicating that DHRPS added incremental information to CVD _ risk

discrimination (Table $1).

DHRPS was relevant across the lifespan

We also evaluated the relationship between DHRPS and CVD across the age spectrum (Figure
$1). As expected, for all six primary outcomes, low DHRPS scores were protective for primary
outcomes across the age spectrum; however, the effects were non-linear. In middle aged and older
participants (starting at age 35), high DHRPS had a statistically significant increase in CVD in
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and coronary atherosclerosis, compared to middle and low
scores. The difference in the prevalence of heart failure between high DHRPS group versus other

groups also increased with age.

DHRPS-based PheW AS

We then assessed the association between DHRPS and all EHR-coded diagnoses. DHRPS-based
PheWAS identified 518 statistically significant phecodes, including previously established CVD
risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and hypertension (Figure 2, Table S2).
PheWAS based on DHRPS had higher statistical significance and at least 1.3 times higher
regression coefficient z-score for primary outcomes, indicating stronger associations with disease
status”). In particular, the coefficient z-scores for DHRPS were stronger than daily heart rate and
step count combined, suggesting that DHRPS encodes additional clinical information beyond daily

heart rate and step count (Figure 3).

Exercise Stress Test Sub-group Analysis

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

In the small subgroup with Fitbit data and exercise stress testing (n=21), DHRPS showed stronger
correlations with max METs achieved on exercise stress testing (p=0.47 [95% CI 0.37-0.56])
compared to steps per day (Ap=0.04, p<0.001) and heart rate (Ap=0.31, p<0.001). Additionally,
data from enrollment surveys for participants with Fitbit data revealed that DHRPS showed

stronger correlations with self-reported physical health than steps per day or heart rate (Figure 4).

Discussion

We report the development and initial validation of a novel wearables biomarker, DHRPS, for
CVD risk discrimination. In this cross-sectional study, we demonstrated that DHRPS was strongly
associated with EHR coding for modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and MACEs. These data
were supported by the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), which evaluated the entire
spectrum of clinical diagnoses associated with a continuous variable without selecting candidate
variables for the model a priori. In the PheWAS, we found that the strongest association with
DHRPS occurred in established CVD risk factors, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea,
and hypertension. Thus, our data establish a relationship between elevated DHRPS and
cardiovascular disease both when we pre-specify cardiovascular risk factors and adverse outcomes

and when we use a hypothesis-free PheWAS approach.

Further supporting the central link between elevated DHRPS and cardiovascular disease, in a 21-
participant subgroup, DHRPS had stronger correlations than steps per day or daily heart rate with
established clinical measures of cardiovascular fitness on cardiovascular treadmill stress tests. The
significance of these findings is that a favorable DHRPS score is a sensitive marker of overall
health in the population. Equally important, DHRPS is a better model discriminator of CVD risk

than either heart rate or steps-per-day.

To put these data in context, the component metrics of DHRPS are strong independent predictors
of CVD risk. More steps per day is strongly associated with decreased risk of CVD and all-cause
mortality'*!>??, The measurement of steps per day is a practical and accessible proxy for assessing
an individual's physical activity level, reflecting lower-level ambulatory activity and sedentary
time”®. Separately, elevated resting heart rate has been positively associated with increased

2425 coronary atherosclerosis”°?’, and heart failure’®. The

incidence of hypertension
parasympathetic nervous system also plays a key role in coordinating exercise capacity, with

higher exercise capacity associated with lower resting heart rate through increased cardiac vagal

activity’.

Given the pathogenic mechanism behind these behavioral biomarkers, we sought to develop
DHRPS, a new wearables metric that quantifies the average heart rate per step taken throughout
the day, by integrating both the frequency of physical activity (steps) and the cardiovascular
response (heart rate) into a single measure. As an individual’s activity levels vary naturally
throughout the day, the heart rate also varies according to physiological demand and in response
to the patient’s underlying fitness level and autonomic state. DHRPS may offer insights into the
heart's responsiveness to increased activity demands, reflecting its capacity to adjust under stress
or exertion through established physiological mechanisms such as coronary flow reserve, which
represents the heart's ability to increase blood flow to meet heightened oxygen demands”. In this
study, DHRPS had stronger associations with CVD than either heart rate or steps per day alone
and was correlated with self-reported physical health, suggesting that this easy-to-calculate metric

may be a superior exposure variable in population health studies.

S707 ‘PZ [dy uo Aq S10" speurnofeye//:dyy wosy popropumog

If validated in future studies, DHRPS may serve as a useful complement to clinical risk scores for
CVD risk prediction. Additional prospective research, including studies that incorporate
cardiopulmonary exercise testing with detailed metabolic data, will be needed to verify which
components of the cardiovascular and autonomic system are being evaluated by DHRPS, and to
delineate the physiologic mechanisms that provide incremental value above steps-per-day and
daily heart rate. With the expanding availability of commercially available wearable devices, this
new biomarker is a potential source of high-quality data that encodes both activity and

cardiovascular fitness.

The cross-sectional nature of All of Us is the most important limitation of this study. The design
prevents establishment of causation or inference of longitudinal relationships. Although we have
many days of DHRPS data for each participant, these are still fundamentally cross-sectional data,
gathered as a convenience sample in a population-health protocol. Therefore, the wearable metrics
were defined as exposure variables for disease prevalence and not chronological risk factors.
Further, the subset of population who choose to participate in the All of Us Fitbit Bring-Your-
Own-Device Project likely introduces selection bias by including a predominance of women, self-
reported white race, and individuals who are interested in tracking their health status in the study
population. While Fitbit devices provide convenient and non-invasive data collection, factors such
as device calibration, sensor accuracy, and participant compliance can influence the precision of
data collected!. Strengths of this study include the large number of participants with wearable

device as well as the paired EHR.

In the All of Us Research Program Fitbit Bring-Your-Own-Device Project, Daily Heart Rate Per
Step (DHRPS) had strong associations with CVD and provided stronger clinical associations with
exercise capacity and aerobic fitness than isolated measures of heart rate or steps per day. With the
expanding availability of commercially available wearable devices, this new biomarker could

potentially enable clinicians to identify individuals at higher risk for poor CVD outcomes.

“High” DHRPS profiles have a large heart rate/step ratio and are associated with higher disease
risks, whereas “low” DHRPS profiles have a small ratio.
*DHRPS was calculated as Heart Rate / Steps Per Day, as noted in the Methods Section. For
convenience of display in the table, it was scaled by multiplying by 10°.
DHRPS = Daily Heart Rate Per Step, SD = Standard Deviation, BMI = Body Mass Index

Figure Legends

Figure 1. Incremental odds ratio and 95% CI for the DHRPS variable in logistic regression
models on each primary outcome.

Models of Primary Cardiovascular Outcomes versus DHRPS. Using 6 logistic regressions,
one with each cardiovascular risk factor as the dependent variable, the odds ratio and 95% CI for
DHRPS were calculated, controlling for the risk factors age, sex, race/ethnicity, and BMI.
Primary outcome with asterisk (*) remain statistically significant after controlling for the same
baseline risk factors plus Steps Per Day and Daily Heart Rate. Dots are point estimates, plus 95%

confidence intervals. The red dotted line represents an odds ratio of | (i.e., no association).

Figure 2. DHRPS-based Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS).

Manhattan plot of DHRPS-based PheWAS. PheWAS analyzes the association between many
phenotypes compared to a single attribute, DHRPS, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity,
BMI. The 1,789 disease codes across 17 disease categories phenotypes were derived from pre-
existing All of Us classifications and the dashed line denotes phenome-wide significance after
Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons, equivalent to a p-value of 2.9x10°>. Larger
log(p-value) represents smaller p-values for the individual phenotype-DHRPS comparisons.

GERD = Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Type II DM = Type II Diabetes Mellitus.
